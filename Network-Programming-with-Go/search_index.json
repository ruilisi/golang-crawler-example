And you can&#39;t build it if you don&#39;t know the environment in which it will work. \nGUI programs are different to batch processing programs; games programs are different to business programs; and distributed programs are different to standalone programs. \nThey each have their approaches, their common patterns, the problems that typically arise and the solutions that are often used.\nThis chapter covers the high level architectural aspects of distributed systems. There are many ways of looking at such systems, and many of these are dealt with. \n"},"architecture/protocol_layers.html":{"url":"architecture/protocol_layers.html","title":"Protocol Layers","body":"Protocol Layers\nDistributed systems are hard. There are multiple computers involved, which have to be connected in some way. Programs have to be written to run on each computer in the system and they all have to co-operate to get a distributed task done.\nThe common way to deal with complexity is to break it down into smaller and simpler parts. These parts have their own structure, but they also have defined means of communicating with other related parts. In distributed systems, the parts are called protocol layers and they have clearly defined functions. They form a stack, with each layer communicating with the layer above and the layer below. The communication between layers is defined by protocols.\nNetwork communications requires protocols to cover high-level application communication all the way down to wire communication and the complexity handled by encapsulation in protocol layers.\nISO OSI Protocol\nAlthough it was never properly implemented, the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) protocol has been a major influence in ways of talking about and influencing distributed systems design. It is commonly given in the following figure: \n\nOSI layers\nThe function of each layer is:\n\nNetwork layer provides switching and routing technologies\n\nTransport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control\n\nSession layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications.\n\nPresentation layer provides independence from differences in data representation (e.g. encryption)\n\nApplication layer supports application and end-user processes\n\n\nTCP/IP Protocol\nWhile the OSI model was being argued, debated, partly implemented and fought over, the DARPA internet research project was busy building the TCP/IP protocols. These have been immensely successful and have led to The Internet (with capitals). This is a much simpler stack:\n\nSome Alternative Protocols\nAlthough it almost seems like it, the TCP/IP protocols are not the only ones in existence and in the long run may not even be the most successful. There are many protocols occupying significant niches, such as\n\nFirewire\nUSB\nBluetooth\nWiFi\n\nThere is active work continuing on many other protocols, even quite bizarre ones such as those for the &quot;internet in space.&quot;\nThe focus in this book will be on the TCP/IP, but you should be aware of these other ones. \n"},"architecture/networking.html":{"url":"architecture/networking.html","title":"Networking","body":"Networking\nA network is a communications system for connecting end systems called hosts. The mechanisms of connection might be copper wire, ethernet, fiber optic or wireless, but that won&#39;t concern us here. A local area network (LAN) connects computers that are close together, typically belonging to a home, small organization or part of a larger organization.\nA Wide Area Network (WAN) connects computers across a larger physical area, such as between cities. There are other types as well, such as MANs (Metropolitan Area Network), PANs (Personal Area Networks) and even BANs (Body Area Network).\nAn internet is a connection of two or more distinct networks, typically LANs or WANs. An intranet is an internet with all networks belonging to a single organization.\nThere are significant differences between an internet and an intranet. Typically an intranet will be under a single administrative control, which will impose a single set of coherent policies. An internet on the other hand will not be under the control of a single body, and the controls exercised over different parts may not even be compatible.\nA trivial example of such differences is that an intranet will often be restricted to computers by a small number of vendors running a standardized version of a particular operating system. On the other hand, an internet will often have a smorgasbord of different computers and operating systems.\nThe techniques of this book will be applicable to internets. They will also be valid for intranets, but there you will also find specialized, non-portable systems.\nAnd then there is the &quot;mother&quot; of all internets: The Internet. This is just a very, very large internet that connects us to Google, my computer to your computer and so on. \n"},"architecture/gateways.html":{"url":"architecture/gateways.html","title":"Gateways","body":"Gateways\nA gateway is a generic term for an entity used to connect two or more networks. A repeater operates at the physical level and copies the information from one subnet to another. A bridge operates at the data link layer level and copies frames between networks. A router operates at the network level and not only moves information between networks but also decides on the route. \n"},"architecture/packet_encapsulation.html":{"url":"architecture/packet_encapsulation.html","title":"Packet encapsulation","body":"Packet encapsulation\nThe communication between layers in either the OSI or the TCP/IP stacks is done by sending packets of data from one layer to the next, and then eventually across the network. Each layer has administrative information that it has to keep about its own layer. It does this by adding header information to the packet it receives from the layer above, as the packet passes down. On the receiving side, these headers are removed as the packet moves up.\nFor example, the TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) moves files from one computer to another. It uses the UDP protocol on top of the IP protocol, which may be sent over Ethernet. This looks like:\n\nThe packet transmitted over ethernet, is of course the bottom one.\n"},"architecture/connection_models.html":{"url":"architecture/connection_models.html","title":"Connection Models","body":"Connection Models\nIn order for two computers to communicate, they must set up a path whereby they can send at least one message in a session. There are two major models for this:\n\nConnection oriented\nConnectionless\n\nConnection oriented\nA single connection is established for the session. Two-way communications flow along the connection. When the session is over, the connection is broken. The analogy is to a phone conversation. An example is TCP\nConnectionless\nIn a connectionless system, messages are sent independent of each other. Ordinary mail is the analogy. Connectionless messages may arrive out of order. An example is the IP protocol. \nConnection oriented transports may be established on top of connectionless ones - TCP over IP. Connectionless transports may be established on top of connection oriented ones - HTTP over TCP.\nThere can be variations on these. For example, a session might enforce messages arriving, but might not guarantee that they arrive in the order sent. However, these two are the most common. \n"},"architecture/communications_models.html":{"url":"architecture/communications_models.html","title":"Communications Models","body":"Communications Models\nMessage passing\nSome non-procedural languages are built on the principle of message passing. Concurrent languages often use such a mechanism, and the most well known example is probably the Unix pipeline. The Unix pipeline is a pipeline of bytes, but there is not an inherent limitation: Microsoft&#39;s PowerShell can send objects along its pipelines, and concurrent languages such as Parlog could send arbitrary logic data structures in messages between concurrent processes.\nMessage passing is a primitive mechanism for distributed systems. Set up a connection and pump some data down it. At the other end, figure out what the message was and respond to it, possibly sending messages back. This is illustrated by \n\n Low level event driven systems such as the X Window System function in a somewhat similar way: wait for message from a user (mouse clicks, etc), decode them and act on them.\nHigher level event driven systems assume that this decoding has been done by the underlying system and the event is then dispatched to an appropriate object such as a ButtonPress handler. This can also be done in distributed message passing systems, whereby a message received across the network is partly decoded and dispatched to an appropriate handler. \nRemote procedure call\nIn any system, there is a transfer of information and flow control from one part of the system to another. In procedural languages this may consist of the procedure call, where information is placed on a call stack and then control flow is transferred to another part of the program.\nEven with procedure calls, there are variations. The code may be statically linked so that control transfers from one part of the program&#39;s executable code to another part. Due to the increasing use of library routines, it has become commonplace to have such code in dynamic link libraries (DLL-s), where control transfers to an independent piece of code.\nDLLs run in the same machine as the calling code. It is a simple (conceptual) step to transfer control to a procedure running in a different machine. The mechanics of this are not so simple! However, this model of control has given rise to the &quot;remote procedure call&quot; (RPC) which is discussed in much detail in a later chapter. This is illustrated by \n\nThere is an historical oddity called the &quot;lightweight remote procedure call&quot; invented by Microsoft as they transitioned from 16-bit to 32-bit applications. A 16-bit application might need to transfer data to a 32-bit application on the same machine. That made it lightweight as there was no networking! But it had many of the other issues of RPC systems in data representations and conversion. \n"},"architecture/distributed_computing_models.html":{"url":"architecture/distributed_computing_models.html","title":"Distributed Computing Models","body":"Distributed Computing Models\nAt the highest level, we could consider the equivalence or the non-equivalence of components of a distributed system. The most common occurrence is an asymmetric one: a client sends requests to a server, and the server responds. This is a client-server system.\nIf both components are equivalent, both able to initiate and to respond to messages, then we have a peer-to-peer system. Note that this is a logical classification: one peer may be a 16,000 core mainframe, the other might be a mobile phone. But if both can act similarly then they are peers.\nA third model is the so-called filter. Here one component passes information to another which modifies it before passing it to a third. This is a fairly common model: for example, the middle component gets information from a database as SQL records and transforms it into an HTML table for the third component (which might be a browser).\nThese are illustrated as: \n\n"},"architecture/clientserver_system.html":{"url":"architecture/clientserver_system.html","title":"Client/Server System","body":"Client/Server System\nAnother view of a client/server system is \n\n"},"architecture/clientserver_application.html":{"url":"architecture/clientserver_application.html","title":"Client/Server Application","body":"Client/Server Application\nAnd a third view is \n\n"},"architecture/server_distribution.html":{"url":"architecture/server_distribution.html","title":"Server Distribution","body":"Server Distribution\nA client-server systems need not be simple.

And of course, there could be multiple clients with multiple servers.\n"},"architecture/component_distribution.html":{"url":"architecture/component_distribution.html","title":"Component Distribution","body":"Component Distribution\nA simple but effective way of decomposing many applications is to consider them as made up of three parts:\n\nPresentation component\nApplication logic\nData access \n\nThe presentation component is responsible for interactions with the user, both displaying data and gathering input. It may be a modern GUI interface with buttons, lists, menus, etc., or an older command-line style interface, asking questions and getting answers. The details are not important at this level.\nThe application logic is responsible for interpreting the users&#39; responses, for applying business rules, for preparing queries and managing responses from the their component.\nThe data access component is responsible for storing and retrieving data. This will often be through a database, but not necessarily. \nGartner Classification\nBased on this threefold decomposition of applications, Gartner considered how the components might be distributed in a client-server system. They came up with five models:\n\nExample: Distributed Database\nGartner classification: 1\n\nModern mobile phones make good examples of this: due to limited memory they may store a small part of a database locally so that they can usual respond quickly. However, if data is required that is not held locally, then a request may be made to a remote database for that additional data.\nGoogle maps forms another good example. All of the maps reside on Google&#39;s servers. When one is requested by a user, the &quot;nearby&quot; maps are also downloaded into a small database in the browser. When the user moves the map a little bit, the extra bits required are already in the local store for quick response. \nExample: Network File Service\nGartner classification 2 allows remote clients access to a shared file system \n\nThere are many examples of such systems: NFS, Microsoft shares, DCE, etc.\nExample: Web\nAn example of Gartner classification 3 is the Web with Java applets. This is a distributed hypertext system, with many additional mechanisms.\n\nExample: Terminal Emulation\nAn example of Gartner classification 4 is terminal emulation. This allows a remote system to act as a normal terminal on a local system. \n\nTelnet is the most common example of this. \nExample: Expect\nExpect is a novel illustration of Gartner classification 5. It acts as a wrapper around a classical system such as a command-line interface. It builds an X Window interface around this, so that the user interacts with a GUI, and the GUI in turn interacts with the command-line interface.\n\nExample: X Window System\nThe X Window System itself is an example of Gartner classification 5. An application makes GUI calls such as DrawLine, but these are not handled directly but instead passed to an X Window server for rendering. This decouples the application view of windowing and the display view of windowing.\n\nThree Tier Models\nOf course, if you have two tiers, then you can have three, four, or more. Some of the three tier possibilities are shown in this diagram: \n\nThe modern Web is a good example of the rightmost of these. The backend is made up of a database, often running stored procedures to hold some of the database logic. The middle tier is an HTTP server such as Apache running PHP scripts (or Ruby on Rails, or JSP pages, etc). This will manage some of the logic and will have data such as HTML pages stored locally. The frontend is a browser to display the pages, under the control of some Javascript. In HTML 5, the frontend may also have a local database. \nFat vs thin\nA common labelling of components is &quot;fat&quot; or &quot;thin&quot;. Fat components take up lots of memory and do complex processing. Thin components on the other hand, do little of either. There don&#39;t seem to be any &quot;normal&quot; size components, only fat or thin!\nFatness or thinness is a relative concept. Browsers are often labelled as thin because &quot;all they do is display web pages&quot;. Firefox on my Linux box takes nearly 1/2 a gigabyte of memory, which I don&#39;t regard as small at all! \n"},"architecture/middleware_model.html":{"url":"architecture/middleware_model.html","title":"Middleware","body":"Middleware\nMiddleware model\nMiddleware is tech &quot;glue&quot; connecting components of a distributed system.

It also looks at raw sockets, in case you need to implement your own protocol above IP. \nIntroduction\nThere are many kinds of networks in the world. \nThese range from the very old such as serial links, through to wide area networks made from copper and fibre, to wireless networks of various kinds, both for computers and for telecommunications devices such as phones. \nThese networks obviously differ at the physical link layer, but in many cases they also differed at higher layers of the OSI stack.\nOver the years there has been a convergence to the &quot;internet stack&quot; of IP and TCP/UDP. \nFor example, Bluetooth defines physical layers and protocol layers, but on top of that is an IP stack so that the same internet programming techniques can be employed on many Bluetooth devices. \nSimilarly, developing 4G wireless phone technologies such as LTE (Long Term Evolution) will also use an IP stack.\nWhile IP provides the networking layer 3 of the OSI stack, TCP and UDP deal with layer 4. \nThese are not the final word, even in the internet world: SCTP has come from the telecommunications to challenge both TCP and UDP, while to provide internet services in interplanetary space requires new, under development protocols such as DTN. \nNevertheless, IP, TCP and UDP hold sway as principal networking technologies now and at least for a considerable time into the future.

Some parts of the OSI standard are obscure, some parts cannot easily be implemented, some parts have not been implemented.\nThe TCP/IP protocol was devised through a long-running DARPA project. This worked by implementation followed by RFCs (Request For Comment). TCP/IP is the principal Unix networking protocol. TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.\nThe TCP/IP stack is shorter than the OSI one: \n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol. \nIP datagrams\nThe IP layer provides a connectionless and unreliable delivery system. It considers each datagram independently of the others. Any association between datagrams must be supplied by the higher layers.\nThe IP layer supplies a checksum that includes its own header. The header includes the source and destination addresses.\nThe IP layer handles routing through an Internet. It is also responsible for breaking up large datagrams into smaller ones for transmission and reassembling them at the other end.\nUDP\nUDP is also connectionless and unreliable. What it adds to IP is a checksum for the contents of the datagram and port numbers. These are used to give a client/server model - see later.\nTCP\nTCP supplies logic to give a reliable connection-oriented protocol above IP. It provides a virtual circuit that two processes can use to communicate. It also uses port numbers to identify services on a host. \n"},"socket/internet_addresses.html":{"url":"socket/internet_addresses.html","title":"Internet addresses","body":"Internet addresses\nIn order to use a service you must be able to find it. \nThe Internet uses an address scheme for devices such as computers so that they can be located. \nThis addressing scheme was originally devised when there were only a handful of connected computers, and very generously allowed upto 2322^{32}232 addresses, using a 32 bit unsigned integer. \nThese are the so-called IPv4 addresses. \nIn recent years, the number of connected (or at least directly addressable) devices has threatened to exceed this number, and so &quot;any day now&quot; we will switch to IPv6 addressing which will allow upto 21282^{128}2128 addresses, using an unsigned 128 bit integer. \nThe changeover is most likely to be forced by emerging countries, as the developed world has already taken nearly all of the pool of IPv4 addresses.\nIPv4 addresses\nThe address is a 32 bit integer which gives the IP address. \nThis addresses down to a network interface card on a single device. \nThe address is usually written as four bytes in decimal with a dot &quot;.&quot; between them, as in 127.0.0.1 or 66.102.11.104.\nThe IP address of any device is generally composed of two parts: the address of the network in which the device resides, and the address of the device within that network. \nOnce upon a time, the split between network address and internal address was simple and was based upon the bytes used in the IP address. \n\nIn a class A network, the first byte identifies the network, while the last three identify the device. There are only 128 class A networks, owned by the very early players in the internet space such as IBM, the General Electric Company and MIT [1]\n\nClass B networks use the first two bytes to identify the network and the last two to identify devices within the subnet. This allows upto 2162^{16}216 (65,536) devices on a subnet\n\nClass C networks use the first three bytes to identify the network and the last one to identify devices within that network. This allows upto 282^828 (actually 254, not 256) devices\n\n\nThis scheme doesn&#39;t work well if you want, say, 400 computers on a network. 254 is too small, while 65,536 is too large. \nIn binary arithmetic terms, you want about 512. \nThis can be achieved by using a 23 bit network address and 9 bits for the device addresses. \nSimilarly, if you want upto 1024 devices, you use a 22 bit network address and a 10 bit device address.\nGiven an IP address of a device, and knowing how many bits N are used for the network address gives a relatively straightforward process for extracting the network address and the device address within that network. \nForm a &quot;network mask&quot; which is a 32-bit binary number with all ones in the first N places and all zeroes in the remaining ones. \nFor example, if 16 bits are used for the network address, the mask is 11111111111111110000000000000000. \nIt&#39;s a little inconvenient using binary, so decimal bytes are usually used. \nThe netmask for 16 bit network addresses is 255.255.0.0, for 24 bit network addresses it is 255.255.255.0, while for 23 bit addresses it would be 255.255.254.0 and for 22 bit addresses it would be 255.255.252.0.\nThen to find the network of a device, bit-wise AND it&#39;s IP address with the network mask, while the device address within the subnet is found with bit-wise AND of the 1&#39;s complement of the mask with the IP address. \nIPv6 addresses\nThe internet has grown vastly beyond original expectations. The initially generous 32-bit addressing scheme is on the verge of running out. There are unpleasant workarounds such as NAT addressing, but eventually we will have to switch to a wider address space. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. Even bytes becomes cumbersome to express such addresses, so hexadecimal digits are used, grouped into 4 digits and separated by a colon &quot;:&quot;. A typical address might be 2002:c0e8:82e7:0:0:0:c0e8:82e7.\nThese addresses are not easy to remember! DNS will become even more important. There are tricks to reducing some addresses, such as eliding zeroes and repeated digits. For example, &quot;localhost&quot; is 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, which can be shortened to ::1.\n"},"socket/ip_address_type.html":{"url":"socket/ip_address_type.html","title":"IP address type","body":"IP address type\nThe package &quot;net&quot; defines many types, functions and methods of use in Go network programming.

They may also have multiple host names, acting as aliases.\nfunc LookupHost(name string) (addrs []string, err os.Error)\n\nOne of these addresses will be labelled as the &quot;canonical&quot; host name. If you wish to find the canonical name, use \nfunc LookupCNAME(name string) (cname string, err os.Error)\n\nThis is shown in the following program     \n/* LookupHost\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;net&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) != 2 {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Usage: %s hostname\\n&quot;, os.Args[0])\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    name := os.Args[1]\n\n    addrs, err := net.LookupHost(name)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Error: &quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(2)\n    }\n\n    for _, s := range addrs {\n        fmt.Println(s)\n    }\n    os.Exit(0)\n}\n\nNote that this function returns strings, not IPAddress values.\n"},"socket/services.html":{"url":"socket/services.html","title":"Services","body":"Services\nServices run on host machines. They are typically long lived and are designed to wait for requests and respond to them. There are many types of services, and there are many ways in which they can offer their services to clients. The internet world bases many of these services on two methods of communication, TCP and UDP, although there are other communication protocols such as SCTP waiting in the wings to take over. Many other types of service, such as peer-to-peer, remote procedure calls, communicating agents, and many others are built on top of TCP and UDP.\nPorts\nServices live on host machines. The IP address will locate the host. But on each computer may be many services, and a simple way is needed to distinguish between them. The method used by TCP, UDP, SCTP and others is to use a port number. This is an unsigned integer between 1 and 65,535 and each service will associate itself with one or more of these port numbers.\nThere are many &quot;standard&quot; ports. Telnet usually uses port 23 with the TCP protocol. DNS uses port 53, either with TCP or with UDP. FTP uses ports 21 and 20, one for commands, the other for data transfer. HTTP usually uses port 80, but it often uses ports 8000, 8080 and 8088, all with TCP. The X Window System often takes ports 6000-6007, both on TCP and UDP.\nOn a Unix system, the commonly used ports are listed in the file /etc/services. Go has a function to interrogate this file \nfunc LookupPort(network, service string) (port int, err os.Error)\n\nThe network argument is a string such as &quot;tcp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;, while the service is a string such as &quot;telnet&quot; or &quot;domain&quot; (for DNS).\nA program using this is \n/* LookupPort\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;net&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) != 3 {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr,\n            &quot;Usage: %s network-type service\\n&quot;,\n            os.Args[0])\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    networkType := os.Args[1]\n    service := os.Args[2]\n\n    port, err := net.LookupPort(networkType, service)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Error: &quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(2)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Service port &quot;, port)\n    os.Exit(0)\n}\n\nFor example, running LookupPort tcp telnet prints Service port: 23.\nThe type TCPAddr\nThe type TCPAddr is a structure containing an IP and a port:\ntype TCPAddr struct {\n    IP   IP\n    Port int\n}\n\nThe function to create a TCPAddr is ResolveTCPAddr\nfunc ResolveTCPAddr(net, addr string) (*TCPAddr, os.Error)\n\nwhere net is one of &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;tcp4&quot; or &quot;tcp6&quot; and the addr is a string composed of a host name or IP address, followed by the port number after a &quot;:&quot;, such as &quot;www.google.com:80&quot; or &quot;127.0.0.1:22&quot;. \nIf the address is an IPv6 address, which already has colons in it, then the host part must be enclosed in square brackets, such as &quot;[::1]:23&quot;. \nAnother special case is often used for servers, where the host address is zero, so that the TCP address is really just the port name, as in &quot;:80&quot; for an HTTP server. \n"},"socket/tcp_sockets.html":{"url":"socket/tcp_sockets.html","title":"TCP Sockets","body":"TCP Sockets\nWhen you know how to reach a service via its network and port IDs, what then? \nIf you are a client you need an API that will allow you to connect to a service and then to send messages to that service and read replies back from the service.\nIf you are a server, you need to be able to bind to a port and listen at it. When a message comes in you need to be able to read it and write back to the client.\nThe net.TCPConn is the Go type which allows full duplex communication between the client and the server. Two major methods of interest are\nfunc (c *TCPConn) Write(b []byte) (n int, err os.Error)\nfunc (c *TCPConn) Read(b []byte) (n int, err os.Error)\n\nA TCPConn is used by both a client and a server to read and write messages. \nTCP client\nOnce a client has established a TCP address for a service, it &quot;dials&quot; the service. If successful, the dial returns a TCPConn for communication. The client and the server exchange messages on this. Typically a client writes a request to the server using the TCPConn, and reads a response from the TCPConn. This continues until either (or both) sides close the connection. A TCP connection is established by the client using the function\nfunc DialTCP(net string, laddr, raddr *TCPAddr) (c *TCPConn, err os.Error)\n\nwhere laddr is the local address which is usually set to nil and raddr is the remote address of the service, and the net string is one of &quot;tcp4&quot;, &quot;tcp6&quot; or &quot;tcp&quot; depending on whether you want a TCPv4 connection, a TCPv6 connection or don&#39;t care.\nA simple example can be provided by a client to a web (HTTP) server. We will deal in substantially more detail with HTTP clients and servers in a later chapter, but for now we will keep it simple.\nOne of the possible messages that a client can send is the &quot;HEAD&quot; message. This queries a server for information about the server and a document on that server. The server returns information, but does not return the document itself. The request sent to query an HTTP server could be\n&quot;HEAD / HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n&quot;\nwhich asks for information about the root document on the server. A typical response might be\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nETag: &quot;-9985996&quot;\nLast-Modified: Thu, 25 Mar 2010 17:51:10 GMT\nContent-Length: 18074\nConnection: close\nDate: Sat, 28 Aug 2010 00:43:48 GMT\nServer: lighttpd/1.4.23\nWe first give the program (GetHeadInfo.go) to establish the connection for a TCP address, send the request string, read and print the response. Once compiled it can be invoked by e.g.\nGetHeadInfo www.google.com:80\nThe program is\n/* GetHeadInfo\n */\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;net&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;io/ioutil&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) != 2 {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Usage: %s host:port &quot;, os.Args[0])\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    service := os.Args[1]\n\n    tcpAddr, err := net.ResolveTCPAddr(&quot;tcp4&quot;, service)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    conn, err := net.DialTCP(&quot;tcp&quot;, nil, tcpAddr)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    _, err = conn.Write([]byte(&quot;HEAD / HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n&quot;))\n    checkError(err)\n\n    result, err := ioutil.ReadAll(conn)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    fmt.Println(string(result))\n\n    os.Exit(0)\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Fatal error: %s&quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nThe first point to note is the almost excessive amount of error checking that is going on. This is normal for networking programs: the opportunities for failure are substantially greater than for standalone programs. Hardware may fail on the client, the server, or on any of the routers and switches in the middle; communication may be blocked by a firewall; timeouts may occur due to network load; the server may crash while the client is talking to it. The following checks are performed:\n\nThere may be syntax errors in the address specified\nThe attempt to connect to the remote service may fail. For example, the service requested might not be running, or there may be no such host connected to the network\nAlthough a connection has been established, writes to the service might fail if the connection has died suddenly, or the network times out\nSimilarly, the reads might fail\n\nReading from the server requires a comment. In this case, we read essentially a single response from the server. This will be terminated by end-of-file on the connection. However, it may consist of several TCP packets, so we need to keep reading till the end of file. The io/ioutil function ReadAll will look after these issues and return the complete response. (Thanks to Roger Peppe on the golang-nuts mailing list.).\nThere are some language issues involved. First, most of the functions return a dual value, with possible error as second value. If no error occurs, then this will be nil. In C, the same behaviour is gained by special values such as NULL, or -1, or zero being returned - if that is possible. In Java, the same error checking is managed by throwing and catching exceptions, which can make the code look very messy.\nIn earlier versions of this program, I returned the result in the array buf, which is of type [512]byte. Attempts to coerce this to a string failed - only byte arrays of type []byte can be coerced. This is a bit of a nuisance. \nA Daytime server\nAbout the simplest service that we can build is the daytime service. This is a standard Internet service, defined by RFC 867, with a default port of 13, on both TCP and UDP. Unfortunately, with the (justified) increase in paranoia over security, hardly any sites run a daytime server any more. Never mind, we can build our own. (For those interested, if you install inetd on your system, you usually get a daytime server thrown in.)\nA server registers itself on a port, and listens on that port. Then it blocks on an &quot;accept&quot; operation, waiting for clients to connect. When a client connects, the accept call returns, with a connection object. The daytime service is very simple and just writes the current time to the client, closes the connection, and resumes waiting for the next client.\nThe relevant calls are\nfunc ListenTCP(net string, laddr *TCPAddr) (l *TCPListener, err os.Error)\nfunc (l *TCPListener) Accept() (c Conn, err os.Error)\n\nThe argument net can be set to one of the strings &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;tcp4&quot; or &quot;tcp6&quot;. The IP address should be set to zero if you want to listen on all network interfaces, or to the IP address of a single network interface if you only want to listen on that interface. If the port is set to zero, then the O/S will choose a port for you. Otherwise you can choose your own. Note that on a Unix system, you cannot listen on a port below 1024 unless you are the system supervisor, root, and ports below 128 are standardized by the IETF. The example program chooses port 1200 for no particular reason. The TCP address is given as &quot;:1200&quot; - all interfaces, port 1200.\nThe program is\n/* DaytimeServer\n */\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;net&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;time&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    service := &quot;:1200&quot;\n    tcpAddr, err := net.ResolveTCPAddr(&quot;tcp4&quot;, service)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    listener, err := net.ListenTCP(&quot;tcp&quot;, tcpAddr)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    for {\n        conn, err := listener.Accept()\n        if err != nil {\n            continue\n        }\n\n        daytime := time.Now().String()\n        conn.Write([]byte(daytime)) // don&#39;t care about return value\n        conn.Close()                // we&#39;re finished with this client\n    }\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Fatal error: %s&quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nIf you run this server, it will just wait there, not doing much. When a client connects to it, it will respond by sending the daytime string to it and then return to waiting for the next client.\nNote the changed error handling in the server as compared to a client. The server should run forever, so that if any error occurs with a client, the server just ignores that client and carries on. A client could otherwise try to mess up the connection with the server, and bring it down!\nWe haven&#39;t built a client. That is easy, just changing the previous client to omit the initial write. Alternatively, just open up a telnet connection to that host:\ntelnet localhost 1200\nThis will produce output such as\n$telnet localhost 1200\nTrying ::1...\nConnected to localhost.\nEscape character is &#39;^]&#39;.\nSun Aug 29 17:25:19 EST 2010Connection closed by foreign host.\nwhere &quot;Sun Aug 29 17:25:19 EST 2010&quot; is the output from the server. \nMulti-threaded server\n&quot;echo&quot; is another simple IETF service. This just reads what the client types, and sends it back:\n/* SimpleEchoServer\n */\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;net&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    service := &quot;:1201&quot;\n    tcpAddr, err := net.ResolveTCPAddr(&quot;tcp4&quot;, service)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    listener, err := net.ListenTCP(&quot;tcp&quot;, tcpAddr)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    for {\n        conn, err := listener.Accept()\n        if err != nil {\n            continue\n        }\n        handleClient(conn)\n        conn.Close() // we&#39;re finished\n    }\n}\n\nfunc handleClient(conn net.Conn) {\n    var buf [512]byte\n    for {\n        n, err := conn.Read(buf[0:])\n        if err != nil {\n            return\n        }\n        fmt.Println(string(buf[0:]))\n        _, err2 := conn.Write(buf[0:n])\n        if err2 != nil {\n            return\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Fatal error: %s&quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nWhile it works, there is a significant issue with this server: it is single-threaded. While a client has a connection open to it, no other client can connect. Other clients are blocked, and will probably time out. Fortunately this is easily fixed by making the client handler a go-routine. We have also moved the connection close into the handler, as it now belongs there\n/* ThreadedEchoServer\n */\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;net&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    service := &quot;:1201&quot;\n    tcpAddr, err := net.ResolveTCPAddr(&quot;tcp4&quot;, service)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    listener, err := net.ListenTCP(&quot;tcp&quot;, tcpAddr)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    for {\n        conn, err := listener.Accept()\n        if err != nil {\n            continue\n        }\n        // run as a goroutine\n        go handleClient(conn)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc handleClient(conn net.Conn) {\n    // close connection on exit\n    defer conn.Close()\n\n    var buf [512]byte\n    for {\n        // read upto 512 bytes\n        n, err := conn.Read(buf[0:])\n        if err != nil {\n            return\n        }\n\n        // write the n bytes read\n        _, err2 := conn.Write(buf[0:n])\n        if err2 != nil {\n            return\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Fatal error: %s&quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\n"},"socket/controlling_tcp_connections.html":{"url":"socket/controlling_tcp_connections.html","title":"Controlling TCP connections","body":"Controlling TCP connections\nTimeout\nThe server may wish to timeout a client if it does not respond quickly enough i.e. does not write a request to the server in time.

The type Conn is an interface and both TCPConn and UDPConn implement this interface. To a large extent you can deal with this interface rather than the two types.\nInstead of separate dial functions for TCP and UDP, you can use a single function\nfunc Dial(net, laddr, raddr string) (c Conn, err os.Error)\n\nThe net can be any of &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;tcp4&quot; (IPv4-only), &quot;tcp6&quot; (IPv6-only), &quot;udp&quot;, &quot;udp4&quot; (IPv4-only), &quot;udp6&quot; (IPv6-only), &quot;ip&quot;, &quot;ip4&quot; (IPv4-only) and &quot;ip6&quot; IPv6-only). It will return an appropriate implementation of the Conn interface. Note that this function takes a string rather than address as raddr argument, so that programs using this can avoid working out the address type first.\nUsing this function makes minor changes to programs.

This data may be highly structured, but has to be serialised for transport. This chapter looks at the basics of serialisation and then considers several techniques supported by Go APIs. \nIntroduction\nA client and server need to exchange information via messages. TCP and UDP provide the transport mechanisms to do this. The two processes also have to have a protocol in place so that message exchange can take place meaningfully.\nMessages are sent across the network as a sequence of bytes, which has no structure except for a linear stream of bytes. We shall address the various possibilities for messages and the protocols that define them in the next chapter. In this chapter we concentrate on a component of messages - the data that is transferred.\nA program will typically build complex data structures to hold the current program state. In conversing with a remote client or service, the program will be attempting to transfer such data structures across the network - that is, outside of the application&#39;s own address space.\nProgramming languages use structured data such as\n\nrecords/structures\nvariant records\narray - fixed size or varying\nstring - fixed size or varying\ntables - e.g. arrays of records\nnon-linear structures such as\ncircular linked list\nbinary tree\nobjects with references to other objects\n\n\n\nNone of IP, TCP or UDP packets know the meaning of any of these data types. All that they can contain is a sequence of bytes. \nThus an application has to serialise any data into a stream of bytes in order to write it, and deserialise the stream of bytes back into suitable data structures on reading it. These two operations are known as marshalling and unmarshalling respectively.\nFor example, consider sending the following variable length table of two columns of variable length strings: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfred\nprogrammer\n\n\nliping\nanalyst\n\n\nsureerat\nmanager\n\n\n\nThis could be done by in various ways. For example, suppose that it is known that the data will be an unknown number of rows in a two-column table. Then a marshalled form could be\n3                // 3 rows, 2 columns assumed\n4 fred           // 4 char string,col 1\n10 programmer    // 10 char string,col 2\n6 liping         // 6 char string, col 1\n7 analyst        // 7 char string, col 2\n8 sureerat       // 8 char string, col 1\n7 manager        // 7 char string, col 2\nVariable length things can alternatively have their length indicated by terminating them with an &quot;illegal&quot; value, such as &#39;\\0&#39; for strings:\n3\nfred\\0        \nprogrammer\\0\nliping\\0\nanalyst\\0\nsureerat\\0\nmanager\\0\nAlternatively, it may be known that the data is a 3-row fixed table of two columns of strings of length 8 and 10 respectively. Then a serialisation could be\nfred\\0\\0\\0\\0\nprogrammer\nliping\\0\\0\nanalyst\\0\\0\\0\nsureerat\nmanager\\0\\0\\0\n Any of these formats is okay - but the message exchange protocol must specify which one is used, or allow it to be determined at runtime.\n"},"dataserialisation/mutual_agreement.html":{"url":"dataserialisation/mutual_agreement.html","title":"Mutual agreement","body":"Mutual agreement\nThe previous section gave an overview of the issue of data serialisation. In practise, the details can be considerably more complex. For example, consider the first possibility, marshalling a table into the stream\n3\n4 fred\n10 programmer\n6 liping\n7 analyst\n8 sureerat\n7 manager\nMany questions arise. For example, how many rows are possible for the table - that is, how big an integer do we need to describe the row size? If it is 255 or less, then a single byte will do, but if it is more, then a short, integer or long may be needed. A similar problem occurs for the length of each string. With the characters themselves, to which character set do they belong? 7 bit ASCII? 16 bit Unicode? The question of character sets is discussed at length in a later chapter.\nThe above serialisation is opaque or implicit. If data is marshalled using the above format, then there is nothing in the serialised data to say how it should be unmarshalled. The unmarshalling side has to know exactly how the data is serialised in order to unmarshal it correctly. For example, if the number of rows is marshalled as an eight-bit integer, but unmarshalled as a sixteen-bit integer, then an incorrect result will occur as the receiver tries to unmarshall 3 and 4 as a sixteen-bit integer, and the receiving program will almost certainly fail later.\nAn early well-known serialisation method is XDR (external data representation) used by Sun&#39;s RPC, later known as ONC (Open Network Computing). XDR is defined by RFC 1832 and it is instructive to see how precise this specification is. Even so, XDR is inherently type-unsafe as serialised data contains no type information. The correctness of its use in ONC is ensured primarily by compilers generating code for both marshalling and unmarshalling.\nGo contains no explicit support for marshalling or unmarshalling opaque serialised data. The RPC package in Go does not use XDR, but instead uses &quot;gob&quot; serialisation, described later in this chapter. \n"},"dataserialisation/self_describing_data.html":{"url":"dataserialisation/self_describing_data.html","title":"Self-describing data","body":"Self-describing data\nSelf-describing data carries type information along with the data.

The unmarshaller will know the type-generation rules and will be able to use this to reconstruct the correct data structure. \n"},"dataserialisation/asn1.html":{"url":"dataserialisation/asn1.html","title":"ASN.1","body":"ASN.1\nAbstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) was originally designed in 1984 for the telecommunications industry. ASN.1 is a complex standard, and a subset of it is supported by Go in the package &quot;asn1&quot;. It builds self-describing serialised data from complex data structures. Its primary use in current networking systems is as the encoding for X.509 certificates which are heavily used in authentication systems. The support in Go is based on what is needed to read and write X.509 certificates.\nTwo functions allow us to marshal and unmarshall data\nfunc Marshal(val interface{}) ([]byte, os.Error)\nfunc Unmarshal(val interface{}, b []byte) (rest []byte, err os.Error)\n\nThe first marshals a data value into a serialised byte array, and the second unmarshalls it. However, the first argument of type interface deserves further examination. Given a variable of a type, we can marshal it by just passing its value. To unmarshall it, we need a variable of a named type that will match the serialised data. The precise details of this are discussed later. But we also need to make sure that the variable is allocated to memory for that type, so that there is actually existing memory for the unmarshalling to write values into.\nWe illustrate with an almost trivial example, of marshalling and unmarshalling an integer. We can pass an integer value to Marshal to return a byte array, and unmarshall the array into an integer variable as in this program:\n/* ASN.1\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;encoding/asn1&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    mdata, err := asn1.Marshal(13)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    var n int\n    _, err1 := asn1.Unmarshal(mdata, &amp;n)\n    checkError(err1)\n\n    fmt.Println(&quot;After marshal/unmarshal: &quot;, n)\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Fatal error: %s&quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nThe unmarshalled value, is of course, 13.\nOnce we move beyond this, things get harder. In order to manage more complex data types, we have to look more closely at the data structures supported by ASN.1, and how ASN.1 support is done in Go.\nAny serialisation method will be able to handle certain data types and not handle some others. So in order to determine the suitability of any serialisation such as ASN.1, you have to look at the possible data types supported versus those you wish to use in your application. The following ASN.1 types are taken from http://www.obj-sys.com/asn1tutorial/node4.html\nThe simple types are\n\nBOOLEAN: two-state variable values\nINTEGER: Model integer variable values\nBIT STRING: Model binary data of arbitrary length\nOCTET STRING: Model binary data whose length is a multiple of eight\nNULL: Indicate effective absence of a sequence element\nOBJECT IDENTIFIER: Name information objects\nREAL: Model real variable values\nENUMERATED: Model values of variables with at least three states\nCHARACTER STRING: Models values that are strings of characters\n\nCharacter strings can be from certain character sets\n\nNumericString: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and space\nPrintableString: Upper and lower case letters, digits, space, apostrophe, left/right parenthesis, plus sign, comma, hyphen, full stop, solidus, colon, equal sign, question mark\nTeletexString (T61String): The Teletex character set in CCITT&#39;s T61, space, and delete\nVideotexString: The Videotex character set in CCITT&#39;s T.100 and T.101, space, and delete\nVisibleString (ISO646String): Printing character sets of international ASCII, and space\nIA5String: International Alphabet 5 (International ASCII)\nGraphicString 25 All registered G sets, and space GraphicString\n\nAnd finally, there are the structured types:\n\nSEQUENCE: Models an ordered collection of variables of different type\nSEQUENCE OF: Models an ordered collection of variables of the same type\nSET: Model an unordered collection of variables of different types\nSET OF: Model an unordered collection of variables of the same type\nCHOICE: Specify a collection of distinct types from which to choose one type\nSELECTION: Select a component type from a specified CHOICE type\nANY: Enable an application to specify the type Note: ANY is a deprecated ASN.1 Structured Type. It has been replaced with X.680 Open Type.\n\nNot all of these are supported by Go. Not all possible values are supported by Go. The rules as given in the Go &quot;asn1&quot; package documentation are\n\nAn ASN.1 INTEGER can be written to an int or int64. If the encoded value does not fit in the Go type, Unmarshal returns a parse error.\nAn ASN.1 BIT STRING can be written to a BitString.\nAn ASN.1 OCTET STRING can be written to a []byte.\nAn ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER can be written to an ObjectIdentifier.\nAn ASN.1 ENUMERATED can be written to an Enumerated.\nAn ASN.1 UTCTIME or GENERALIZEDTIME can be written to a *time.Time.\nAn ASN.1 PrintableString or IA5String can be written to a string.\nAny of the above ASN.1 values can be written to an interface{}. The value stored in the interface has the corresponding Go type. For integers, that type is int64.\nAn ASN.1 SEQUENCE OF x or SET OF x can be written to a slice if an x can be written to * the slice&#39;s element type.\nAn ASN.1 SEQUENCE or SET can be written to a struct if each of the elements in the * sequence can be written to the corresponding element in the struct.\n\nGo places real restrictions on ASN.1. For example, ASN.1 allows integers of any size, while the Go implementation will only allow upto signed 64-bit integers. On the other hand, Go distinguishes between signed and unsigned types, while ASN.1 doesn&#39;t. So for example, transmitting a value of uint64 may fail if it is too large for int64.\nIn a similar vein, ASN.1 allows several different character sets. Go only supports PrintableString and IA5String (ASCII). ASN.1 does not support Unicode characters (which require the BMPString ASN.1 extension). The basic Unicode character set of Go is not supported, and if an application requires transport of Unicode characters, then an encoding such as UTF-7 will be needed. Such encodings are discussed in a later chapter on character sets.\nWe have seen that a value such as an integer can be easily marshalled and unmarshalled. Other basic types such as booleans and reals can be similarly dealt with. Strings which are composed entirely of ASCII characters can be marshalled and unmarshalled. However, if the string is, for example, &quot;hello \\u00bc&quot; which contains the non-ASCII character &#39;¼&#39; then an error will occur: &quot;ASN.1 structure error: PrintableString contains invalid character&quot;. This code works, as long as the string is only composed of printable characters:\ns := &quot;hello&quot;\nmdata, _ := asn1.Marshal(s)\n\nvar newstr string\nasn1.Unmarshal(mdata, &amp;newstr)\n\nASN.1 also includes some &quot;useful types&quot; not in the above list, such as UTC time. Go supports this UTC time type. This means that you can pass time values in a way that is not possible for other data values. ASN.1 does not support pointers, but Go has special code to manage pointers to time values. The function GetLocalTime returns *time.Time. The special code marshals this, and it can be unmarshalled into a pointer variable to a time.Time object. Thus this code works\nt := time.LocalTime()\nmdata, err := asn1.Marshal(t)\n\nvar newtime = new(time.Time)\n_, err1 := asn1.Unmarshal(&amp;newtime, mdata)\n\nBoth LocalTime and new handle pointers to a *time.Time, and Go looks after this special case.\nIn general, you will probably want to marshal and unmarshall structures. Apart from the special case of time, Go will happily deal with structures, but not with pointers to structures. Operations such as new create pointers, so you have to dereference them before marshalling/unmarshalling them. Go normally dereferences pointers for you when needed, but not in this case. These both work for a type T:\n// using variables\nvar t1 T\nt1 = ...\nmdata1, _ := asn1.Marshal(t)\n\nvar newT1 T\nasn1.Unmarshal(&amp;newT1, mdata1)\n\n/// using pointers\nvar t2 = new(T)\n*t2 = ...\nmdata2, _ := asn1.Marshal(*t2)\n\nvar newT2 = new(T)\nasn1.Unmarshal(newT2, mdata2)\n\nAny suitable mix of pointers and variables will work as well.\nThe fields of a structure must all be exportable, that is, field names must begin with an uppercase letter. Go uses the reflect package to marshall/unmarshall structures, so it must be able to examine all fields. This type cannot be marshalled:\ntype T struct {\n  Field1 int\n  field2 int // not exportable\n}\n\nASN.1 only deals with the data types. It does not consider the names of structure fields. So the following type T1 can be marshalled/unmarshalled into type T2 as the corresponding fields are the same types:\ntype T1 struct {\n    F1 int\n    F2 string\n}\n\ntype T2 struct {\n    FF1 int\n    FF2 string\n}\n\nNot only the types of each field must match, but the number must match as well.

It was designed to be a lightweight means of passing data between JavaScript systems. It uses a text-based format and is sufficiently general that it has become used as a general purpose serialisation method for many programming languages.\nJSON serialises objects, arrays and basic values. The basic values include string, number, boolean values and the null value. Arrays are a comma-separated list of values that can represent arrays, vectors, lists or sequences of various programming languages. They are delimited by square brackets [ ... ]. Objects are represented by a list of &quot;field: value&quot; pairs enclosed in curly braces { ... }.\nFor example, the table of employees given earlier could be written as an array of employee objects:\n[\n   {Name: fred, Occupation: programmer},\n   {Name: liping, Occupation: analyst},\n   {Name: sureerat, Occupation: manager}\n]\nThere is no special support for complex data types such as dates, no distinction between number types, no recursive types, etc. JSON is a very simple language, but nevertheless can be quite useful. Its text-based format makes it easy for people to use, even though it has the overheads of string handling.\nFrom the Go JSON package specification, marshalling uses the following type-dependent default encodings:\n\nBoolean values encode as JSON booleans.\nFloating point and integer values encode as JSON numbers.\nString values encode as JSON strings, with each invalid UTF-8 sequence replaced by the encoding of the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD.\nArray and slice values encode as JSON arrays, except that []byte encodes as a base64-encoded string.\nStruct values encode as JSON objects. Each struct field becomes a member of the object. By default the object&#39;s key name is the struct field name converted to lower case. If the struct field has a tag, that tag will be used as the name instead.\nMap values encode as JSON objects. The map&#39;s key type must be string; the object keys are used directly as map keys.\nPointer values encode as the value pointed to. (Note: this allows trees, but not graphs!). A nil pointer  encodes as the null JSON object.\nInterface values encode as the value contained in the interface. A nil interface value encodes as the null  JSON object.\nChannel, complex, and function values cannot be encoded in JSON. Attempting to encode such a value cause Marshal to return an InvalidTypeError.\nJSON cannot represent cyclic data structures and Marshal does not handle them.

It is designed to encode Go data types specifically and does not at present have support for or by any other languages. It supports all Go data types except for channels and functions. It supports integers of all types and sizes, strings and booleans, structs, arrays and slices. At present it has some problems with circular structures such as rings, but that will improve over time.\nGob encodes type information into its serialised forms. This is far more extensive than the type information in say an X.509 serialisation, but far more efficient than the type information contained in an XML document. Type information is only included once for each piece of data, but includes, for example, the names of struct fields.\nThis inclusion of type information makes Gob marshalling and unmarshalling fairly robust to changes or differences between the marshaller and unmarshaller. For example, a struct\nstruct T {\n    a int\n    b int\n}\n\ncan be marshalled and then unmarshalled into a different struct\nstruct T {\n    b int\n    a int\n}\n\nwhere the order of fields has changed. It can also cope with missing fields (the values are ignored) or extra fields (the fields are left unchanged). It can cope with pointer types, so that the above struct could be unmarshalled into\nstruct T {\n    *a int\n    **b int\n}\n\nTo some extent it can cope with type coercions so that an int field can be broadened into an int64, but not with incompatible types such as int and uint.\nTo use Gob to marshall a data value, you first need to create an Encoder. This takes a Writer as parameter and marshalling will be done to this write stream. The encoder has a method Encode which marshalls the value to the stream. This method can be called multiple times on multiple pieces of data. Type information for each data type is only written once, though.\nYou use a Decoder to unmarshall the serialised data stream.

The messages from client to server and vice versa are disjoint: &quot;LOGIN&quot; from client to server is different to &quot;LOGIN&quot; from server to client. \n"},"applevelprotocols/data_format.html":{"url":"applevelprotocols/data_format.html","title":"Data Format","body":"Data Format\nThere are two main format choices for messages: byte encoded or character encoded.\nByte format\nIn the byte format\n\nthe first part of the message is typically a byte to distinguish between message types.\nThe message handler would examine this first byte to distinguish message type and then perform a switch to select the appropriate handler for that type.\nFurther bytes in the message would contain message content according to a pre-defined format (as discussed in the previous chapter).\n\nThe advantages are compactness and hence speed. The disadvantages are caused by the opaqueness of the data: it may be harder to spot errors, harder to debug, require special purpose decoding functions. There are many examples of byte-encoded formats, including major protocols such as DNS and NFS, upto recent ones such as Skype. Of course, if your protocol is not publicly specified, then a byte format can also make it harder for others to reverse-engineer it!\nPseudocode for a byte-format server is\nhandleClient(conn) {\n    while (true) {\n        byte b = conn.readByte()\n        switch (b) {\n            case MSG_1: ...\n            case MSG_2: ...\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}\nGo has basic support for managing byte streams. The interface Conn has methods\nfunc (c Conn) Read(b []byte) (n int, err os.Error)\nfunc (c Conn) Write(b []byte) (n int, err os.Error)\n\nand these methods are implemented by TCPConn and UDPConn. \nCharacter Format\nIn this mode, everything is sent as characters if possible. For example, an integer 234 would be sent as, say, the three characters &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39; and &#39;4&#39; instead of the one byte 234. Data that is inherently binary may be base64 encoded to change it into a 7-bit format and then sent as ASCII characters, as discussed in the previous chapter.\nIn character format,\n\nA message is a sequence of one or more lines\nThe start of the first line of the message is typically a word that represents the message type.\nString handling functions may be used to decode the message type and data.\nThe rest of the first line and successive lines contain the data.\nLine-oriented functions and line-oriented conventions are used to manage this.\n\nPseudocode is\nhandleClient() {\n    line = conn.readLine()\n    if (line.startsWith(...) {\n        ...\n    } else if (line.startsWith(...) {\n        ...\n    }\n}\nCharacter formats are easier to setup and easier to debug. For example, you can use telnet to connect to a server on any port, and send client requests to that server. It isn&#39;t so easy the other way, but you can use tools like tcpdump to snoop on TCP traffic and see immediately what clients are sending to servers.\nThere is not the same level of support in Go for managing character streams. There are significant issues with character sets and character encodings, and we will explore these issues in a later chapter.\nIf we just pretend everything is ASCII, like it was once upon a time, then character formats are quite straightforward to deal with. The principal complication at this level is the varying status of &quot;newline&quot; across different operating systems. Unix uses the single character &quot;\\n&quot;. Windows and others (more correctly) use the pair &quot;\\r\\n&quot;. On the internet, the pair &quot;\\r\\n&quot; is most common - Unix systems just need to take care that they don&#39;t assume &quot;\\n&quot;. \n"},"applevelprotocols/simple_example.html":{"url":"applevelprotocols/simple_example.html","title":"Simple Example","body":"Simple Example\nThis example deals with a directory browsing protocol - basically a stripped down version of FTP, but without even the file transfer part. We only consider listing a directory name, listing the contents of a directory and changing the current directory - all on the server side, of course. This is a complete worked example of creating all components of a client-server application. It is a simple program which includes messages in both directions, as well as design of messaging protocol.\nLook at a simple non-client-server program that allows you to list files in a directory and change and print the directory on the server. We omit copying files, as that adds to the length of the program without really introducing important concepts. For simplicity, all filenames will be assumed to be in 7-bit ASCII. If we just looked at a standalone application first, then the pseudo-code would be\nread line from user\nwhile not eof do\n  if line == dir\n    list directory\n  else\n\n  if line == cd &lt;dir&gt;\n    change directory\n  else\n\n  if line == pwd\n    print directory\n  else\n\n  if line == quit\n    quit\n  else\n    complain\n\n  read line from user\nA non-distributed application would just link the UI and file access code \n\nIn a client-server situation, the client would be at the user end, talking to a server somewhere else. Aspects of this program belong solely at the presentation end, such as getting the commands from the user. Some are messages from the client to the server, some are solely at the server end. \n\n For a simple directory browser, assume that all directories and files are at the server end, and we are only transferring file information from the server to the client. The client side (including presentation aspects) will become\nread line from user\nwhile not eof do\n  if line == dir\n    *list directory*\n  else\n\n  if line == cd &lt;dir&gt;\n    *change directory*\n  else\n\n  if line == pwd\n    *print directory*\n  else\n\n  if line == quit\n    quit\n  else\n    complain\n\n  read line from user\nwhere the stared lines involve communication with the server.\nAlternative presentation aspects\nA GUI program would allow directory contents to be displayed as lists, for files to be selected and actions such as change directory to be be performed on them. The client would be controlled by actions associated with various events that take place in graphical objects. The pseudo-code might look like\nchange dir button:\n  if there is a selected file\n    *change directory*\n  if successful\n    update directory label\n    *list directory*\n    update directory list\nThe functions called from the different UI&#39;s should be the same - changing the presentation should not change the networking code \nProtocol - informal\n\n\n\nclient request\nserver response\n\n\n\n\ndir\nsend list of files\n\n\ncd &lt;dir&gt;\nchange dir send error if failed send ok if succeed\n\n\npwd\nsend current directory\n\n\nquit\nquit \n\n\n\nText protocol\nThis is a simple protocol. The most complicated data structure that we need to send is an array of strings for a directory listing. In this case we don&#39;t need the heavy duty serialisation techniques of the last chapter. In this case we can use a simple text format.\nBut even if we make the protocol simple, we still have to specify it in detail. We choose the following message format:\n\nAll messages are in 7-bit US-ASCII\nThe messages are case-sensitive\nEach message consists of a sequence of lines\nThe first word on the first line of each message describes the message type. All other words are message data\nAll words are separated by exactly one space character\nEach line is terminated by CR-LF\n\nSome of the choices made above are weaker in real-life protocols. For example\n\nMessage types could be case-insensitive. This just requires mapping message type strings down to lower-case before decoding\nAn arbitrary amount of white space could be left between words. This just adds a little more complication, compressing white space\nContinuation characters such as &quot;\\&quot; can be used to break long lines over several lines. This starts to make processing more complex\nJust a &quot;\\n&quot; could be used as line terminator, as well as &quot;\\r\\n&quot;. This makes recognising end of line a bit harder\n\nAll of these variations exist in real protocols. Cumulatively, they make the string processing just more complex than in our case. \n\n\n\nclient request\nserver response\n\n\n\n\nsend &quot;DIR&quot;\nsend list of files, one per line terminated by a blank line\n\n\nsend &quot;CD &lt;dir&gt;&quot;\nchange dir send &quot;ERROR&quot;

For example\n\nKeeping file pointers to current file location\nKeeping current mouse position\nKeeping current customer value\n\nIn a distributed system, such state information may be kept in the client, in the server, or in both.\nThe important point is to whether one process is keeping state information about itself or about the other process. One process may keep as much state information about itself as it wants, without causing any problems. If it needs to keep information about the state of the other process, then problems arise: the process&#39; actual knowledge of the state of the other may become incorrect. This can be caused by loss of messages (in UDP), by failure to update, or by s/w errors.\nAn example is reading a file. In single process applications the file handling code runs as part of the application. It maintains a table of open files and the location in each of them. Each time a read or write is done this file location is updated. In the DCE file system, the file server keeps track of a client&#39;s open files, and where the client&#39;s file pointer is. If a message could get lost (but DCE uses TCP) these could get out of synch. If the client crashes, the server must eventually timeout on the client&#39;s file tables and remove them. \n\nIn NFS, the server does not maintain this state. The client does. Each file access from the client that reaches the server must open the file at the appropriate point, as given by the client, to perform the action.\n\n If the server maintains information about the client, then it must be able to recover if the client crashes. If information is not saved, then on each transaction the client must transfer sufficient information for the server to function.\nIf the connection is unreliable, then additional handling must be in place to ensure that the two do not get out of synch. The classic example is of bank account transactions where the messages get lost. A transaction server may need to be part of the client-server system.\nApplication State Transition Diagram\nA state transition diagram keeps track of the current state of an application and the changes that move it to new states.\nExample: file transfer with login: \n\nThis can also be expressed as a table \n\n\n\nCurrent state\nTransition\nNext state\n\n\n\n\nlogin\nlogin failed\nlogin\n\n\n\nlogin succeeded\nfile transfer\n\n\nfile transfer\ndir\nfile transfer\n\n\n\nget\nfile transfer\n\n\n\nlogout\nlogin\n\n\n\nquit\n- \n\n\n\nClient state transition diagrams\nThe client state diagram must follow the application diagram.

There are also many ways of encoding character sets into binary formats of bytes. This chapter considers some of the issues in this.\nIntroduction\nOnce upon a time there was EBCDIC and ASCII... Actually, it was never that simple and has just become more complex over time. There is light on the horizon, but some estimates are that it may be 50 years before we all live in the daylight on this!\nEarly computers were developed in the English speaking countries of the US, the UK and Australia. As a result of this, assumptions were made about the language and character sets in use. Basically, the Latin alphabet was used, plus numerals, punctuation characters and a few others. These were then encoded into bytes using ASCII or EBCDIC.\nThe character-handling mechanisms were based on this: text files and I/O consisted of a sequence of bytes, with each byte representing a single character. String comparison could be done by matching corresponding bytes; conversions from upper to lower case could be done by mapping individual bytes, and so on.\nThere are about 6,000 living languages in the world (3,000 of them in Papua New Guinea!). A few languages use the &quot;english&quot; characters but most do not. The Romanic languages such as French have adornments on various characters, so that you can write &quot;j&#39;ai arrêté&quot;, with two differently accented vowels. Similarly, the Germanic languages have extra characters such as &#39;ß&#39;. Even UK English has characters not in the standard ASCII set: the pound symbol &#39;£&#39; and recently the euro &#39;€&#39;\nBut the world is not restricted to variations on the Latin alphabet. Thailand has its own alphabet, with words looking like this: &quot;ภาษาไทย&quot;. There are many other alphabets, and Japan even has two, Hiragana and Katagana.\nThere are also the hieroglyphic languages such as Chinese where you can write &quot;百度一下，你就知道&quot;.\nIt would be nice from a technical viewpoint if the world just used ASCII. However, the trend is in the opposite direction, with more and more users demanding that software use the language that they are familiar with. If you build an application that can be run in different countries then users will demand that it uses their own language. In a distributed system, different components of the system may be used by users expecting different languages and characters.\nInternationalisation (i18n) is how you write your applications so that they can handle the variety of languages and cultures. \nLocalisation (l10n) is the process of customising your internationalised application to a particular cultural group.\ni18n and l10n are big topics in themselves. For example, they cover issues such as colours: while white means &quot;purity&quot; in Western cultures, it means &quot;death&quot; to the Chinese and &quot;joy&quot; to Egyptians. In this chapter we just look at issues of character handling. \n"},"encoding/definitions.html":{"url":"encoding/definitions.html","title":"Definitions","body":"Definitions\nIt is important to be careful about exactly what part of a text handling system you are talking about. Here is a set of definitions that have proven useful.\nCharacter\nA character is a &quot;unit of information that roughly corresponds to a grapheme (written symbol) of a natural language, such as a letter, numeral, or punctuation mark&quot; (Wikipedia). A character is &quot;the smallest component of written language that has a semantic value&quot; (Unicode). This includes letters such as &#39;a&#39; and &#39;À&#39; (or letters in any other language), digits such as &#39;2&#39;, punctuation characters such as &#39;,&#39; and various symbols such as the English pound currency symbol &#39;£&#39;.\nA character is some sort of abstraction of any actual symbol: the character &#39;a&#39; is to any written &#39;a&#39; as a Platonic circle is to any actual circle. The concept of character also includes control characters, which do not correspond to natural language symbols but to other bits of information used to process texts of the language.\nA character does not have any particular appearance, although we use the appearance to help recognise the character. However, even the appearance may have to be understood in a context: in mathematics, if you see the symbol π (pi) it is the character for the ratio of circumference to radius of a circle, while if you are reading Greek text, it is the sixteenth letter of the alphabet: &quot;προσ&quot; is the greek word for &quot;with&quot; and has nothing to do with 3.14159...\nCharacter repertoire/character set\nA character repertoire is a set of distinct characters, such as the Latin alphabet. No particular ordering is assumed. In English, although we say that &#39;a&#39; is earlier in the alphabet than &#39;z&#39;, we wouldn&#39;t say that &#39;a&#39; is less than &#39;z&#39;. The &quot;phone book&quot; ordering which puts &quot;McPhee&quot; before &quot;MacRea&quot; shows that &quot;alphabetic ordering&quot; isn&#39;t critical to the characters.\nA repertoire specifies the names of the characters and often a sample of how the characters might look. e.g the letter &#39;a&#39; might look like &#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39; or &#39;a&#39;. But it doesn&#39;t force them to look like that - they are just samples. The repertoire may make distinctions such as upper and lower case, so that &#39;a&#39; and &#39;A&#39; are different. But it may regard them as the same, just with different sample appearances. (Just like some programming languages treat upper and lower as different - e.g. Go - but some don&#39;t e.g. Basic.). On the other hand, a repertoire might contain different characters with the same sample appearance: the repertoire for a Greek mathematician would have two different characters with appearance π. This is also called a noncoded character set.\nCharacter code\nA character code is a mapping from characters to integers. The mapping for a character set is also called a coded character set or code set. The value of each character in this mapping is often called a code point. ASCII is a code set. The codepoint for &#39;a&#39; is 97 and for &#39;A&#39; is 65 (decimal).\nThe character code is still an abstraction. It isn&#39;t yet what we will see in text files, or in TCP packets. However, it is getting close. as it supplies the mapping from human oriented concepts into numerical ones.\nCharacter encoding\nTo communicate or store a character you need to encode it in some way. To transmit a string, you need to encode all characters in the string. There are many possible encodings for any code set.\nFor example, 7-bit ASCII code points can be encoded as themselves into 8-bit bytes (an octet). So ASCII &#39;A&#39; (with codepoint 65) is encoded as the 8-bit octet 01000001. However, a different encoding would be to use the top bit for parity checking e.g. with odd parity ASCII &#39;A&quot; would be the octet 11000001. Some protocols such as Sun&#39;s XDR use 32-bit word-length encoding. ASCII &#39;A&#39; would be encoded as 00000000 00000000 0000000 01000001.\nThe character encoding is where we function at the programming level. Our programs deal with encoded characters. It obviously makes a difference whether we are dealing with 8-bit characters with or without parity checking, or with 32-bit characters.\nThe encoding extends to strings of characters. A word-length even parity encoding of &quot;ABC&quot; might be 10000000 (parity bit in high byte) 0100000011 (C) 01000010 (B) 01000001 (A in low byte). The comments about the importance of an encoding apply equally strongly to strings, where the rules may be different.\nTransport encoding\nA character encoding will suffice for handling characters within a single application. However, once you start sending text between applications, then there is the further issue of how the bytes, shorts or words are put on the wire. An encoding can be based on space- and hence bandwidth-saving techniques such as zip&#39;ping the text. Or it could be reduced to a 7-bit format to allow a parity checking bit, such as base64.\nIf we do know the character and transport encoding, then it is a matter of programming to manage characters and strings. If we don&#39;t know the character or transport encoding then it is a matter of guesswork as to what to do with any particular string. There is no convention for files to signal the character encoding.\nThere is however a convention for signalling encoding in text transmitted across the internet. It is simple: the header of a text message contains information about the encoding. For example, an HTTP header can contain lines such as\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nwhich says that the character set is ISO 8859-4 (corresponding to certain countries in Europe) with the default encoding, but then gziped. The second part - content encoding - is what we are referring to as &quot;transfer encoding&quot; (IETF RFC 2130).\nBut how do you read this information? Isn&#39;t it encoded? Don&#39;t we have a chicken and egg situation? Well, no. The convention is that such information is given in ASCII (to be precise, US ASCII) so that a program can read the headers and then adjust its encoding for the rest of the document. \n"},"encoding/ascii.html":{"url":"encoding/ascii.html","title":"ASCII","body":"ASCII\n ASCII has the repertoire of the English characters plus digits, punctuation and some control characters.

Due to European desires for accented characters, some punctuation characters are omitted to form a minimal set, ISO 646, while there are &quot;national variants&quot; with suitable European characters. The page by Jukka Korpela has more information for those interested. We shall not need these variants though. \n"},"encoding/iso_8859.html":{"url":"encoding/iso_8859.html","title":"ISO 8859","body":"ISO 8859\n Octets are now the standard size for bytes. This allows 128 extra code points for extensions to ASCII. A number of different code sets to capture the repertoires of various subsets of European languages are the ISO 8859 series. ISO 8859-1 is also known as Latin-1 and covers many languages in western Europe, while others in this series cover the rest of Europe and even Hebrew, Arabic and Thai. For example, ISO 8859-5 includes the Cyrillic characters of countries such as Russia, while ISO 8859-8 includes the Hebrew alphabet.\nThe standard encoding for these character sets is to use their code point as an 8-bit value. For example, the character &#39;Á&#39; in ISO 8859-1 has the code point 193 and is encoded as 193. All of the ISO 8859 series have the bottom 128 values identical to ASCII, so that the ASCII characters are the same in all of these sets.\nThe HTML specifications used to recommend the ISO 8859-1 character set. HTML 3.2 was the last one to do so, and after that HTML 4.0 recommended Unicode. In 2010 Google made an estimate that of the pages it sees, about 20% were still in ISO 8859 format while 20% were still in ASCII (Unicode nearing 50% of the web). \n"},"encoding/unicode.html":{"url":"encoding/unicode.html","title":"Unicode","body":"Unicode\n Neither ASCII nor ISO 8859 cover the languages based on hieroglyphs. Chinese is estimated to have about 20,000 separate characters, with about 5,000 in common use. These need more than a byte, and typically two bytes has been used. There have been many of these two-byte character sets: Big5, EUC-TW, GB2312 and GBK/GBX for Chinese, JIS X 0208 for Japanese, and so on. These encodings are generally not mutually compatable.\nUnicode is an embracing standard character set intended to cover all major character sets in use. It includes European, Asian, Indian and many more. It is now up to version 5.2 and has over 107,000 characters. The number of code points now exceeds 65,536, that is. more than 2^16. This has implications for character encodings.\nThe first 256 code points correspond to ISO 8859-1, with US ASCII as the first 128. There is thus a backward compatibility with these major character sets, as the code points for ISO 8859-1 and ASCII are exactly the same in Unicode. The same is not true for other character sets: for example, while most of the Big5 characters are also in Unicode, the code points are not the same. The page contains one example of a (large) table mapping from Big5 to Unicode.\nTo represent Unicode characters in a computer system, an encoding must be used. The encoding UCS is a two-byte encoding using the code point values of the Unicode characters. However, since there are now too many characters in Unicode to fit them all into 2 bytes, this encoding is obsolete and no longer used. Instead there are:\n\nUTF-32 is a 4-byte encoding, but is not commonly used, and HTML 5 warns explicitly against using it\nUTF-16 encodes the most common characters into 2 bytes with a further 2 bytes for the &quot;overflow&quot;, with ASCII and ISO 8859-1 having the usual values\nUTF-8 uses between 1 and 4 bytes per character, with ASCII having the usual values (but not ISO 8859-1)\nUTF-7 is used sometimes, but is not common\n\n"},"encoding/utf-8_go_and_runes.html":{"url":"encoding/utf-8_go_and_runes.html","title":"UTF-8 Go and runes","body":"UTF-8 Go and runes\nUTF-8 is the most commonly used encoding. Google estimates that 50% of the pages that it sees are encoded in UTF-8. The ASCII set has the same encoding values in UTF-8, so a UTF-8 reader can read text consisting of just ASCII characters as well as text from the full Unicode set.\nGo uses UTF-8 encoded characters in its strings. Each character is of type rune. This is a alias for int32 as a Unicode character can be 1, 2 or 4 bytes in UTF-8 encoding. In terms of characters, a string is an array of runes.\nA string is also an array of bytes, but you have to be careful: only for the ASCII subset is a byte equal to a character. All other characters occupy two, three or four bytes. This means that the length of a string in characters (runes) is generally not the same as the length of its byte array. They are only equal when the string consists of ASCII characters only.\nThe following program fragment illustrates this. If we take a UTF-8 string and test its length, you get the length of the underlying byte array. But if you cast the string to an array of runes []rune then you get an array of the Unicode code points which is generally the number of characters:\nstr := &quot;百度一下，你就知道&quot;\n\nprintln(&quot;String length&quot;, len([]rune(str)))\nprintln(&quot;Byte length&quot;, len(str))\n\nprints\nString length 9\nByte length 27\nUTF-8 client and server\nPossibly surprisingly, you need do nothing special to handle UTF-8 text in either the client or the server. The underlying data type for a UTF-8 string in Go is a byte array, and as we saw just above, Go looks after encoding the string into 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes as needed. The length of the string is the length of the byte array, so you write any UTF-8 string by writing the byte array.\nSimilarly to read a string, you just read into a byte array and then cast the array to a string using string([]byte). If Go cannot properly decode bytes into Unicode characters, then it gives the Unicode Replacement Character \\uFFFD. The length of the resulting byte array is the length of the legal portion of the string.\nSo the clients and servers given in earlier chapters work perfectly well with UTF-8 encoded text.\nASCII client and server\nThe ASCII characters have the same encoding in ASCII and in UTF-8. So ordinary UTF-8 character handling works fine for ASCII characters. No special handling need to be done. \n"},"encoding/utf-16_and_go.html":{"url":"encoding/utf-16_and_go.html","title":"UTF-16 and Go","body":"UTF-16 and Go\nUTF-16 deals with arrays of short 16-bit unsigned integers. The package utf16 is designed to manage such arrays. To convert a normal Go string, that is a UTF-8 string, into UTF-16, you first extract the code points by coercing it into a []rune and then use utf16.Encode to produce an array of type uint16.\nSimilarly, to decode an array of unsigned short UTF-16 values into a Go string, you use utf16.Decode to convert it into code points as type []rune and then to a string. The following code fragment illustrates this\nstr := &quot;百度一下，你就知道&quot;\n\nrunes := utf16.Encode([]rune(str))\nints := utf16.Decode(runes)\n\nstr = string(ints)\n\nThese type conversions need to be applied by clients or servers as appropriate, to read and write 16-bit short integers, as shown below.\nLittle-endian and big-endian\nUnfortunately, there is a little devil lurking behind UTF-16. It is basically an encoding of characters into 16-bit short integers. The big question is: for each short, how is it written as two bytes? The top one first, or the top one second? Either way is fine, as long as the receiver uses the same convention as the sender.\nUnicode has addressed this with a special character known as the BOM (byte order marker).

In particular we don&#39;t want to delve into the arcane areas of Unicode. But you should know that Unicode is not a simple encoding and there are many complexities. For example, some earlier character sets used non-spacing characters, particularly for accents. This was brought into Unicode, so you can produce accented characters in two ways: as a single Unicode character, or as a pair of non-spacing accent plus non-accented character. \nFor example, U+04D6 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER IE WITH BREVE is a single character. It is equivalent to U+0415 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER IE combined with the breve accent U+0306 COMBINING BREVE. This makes string comparison difficult on occasions. The Go specification does not at present address such issues. \n"},"encoding/iso_8859_and_go.html":{"url":"encoding/iso_8859_and_go.html","title":"ISO 8859 and Go","body":"ISO 8859 and Go\nThe ISO 8859 series are 8-bit character sets for different parts of Europe and some other areas. They all have the ASCII set common in the low part, but differ in the top part. According to Google, ISO 8859 codes account for about 20% of the web pages it sees.\nThe first code, ISO 8859-1 or Latin-1, has the first 256 characters in common with Unicode. The encoded value of the Latin-1 characters is the same in UTF-16 and in the default ISO 8859-1 encoding. But this doesn&#39;t really help much, as UTF-16 is a 16-bit encoding and ISO 8859-1 is an 8-bit encoding. UTF-8 is a 8-bit encoding, but it uses the top bit to signal extra bytes, so only the ASCII subset overlaps for UTF-8 and ISO 8859-1. So UTF-8 doesn&#39;t help much either.\nBut the ISO 8859 series don&#39;t have any complex issues. To each character in each set corresponds a unique Unicode character. For example, in ISO 8859-2, the character &quot;latin capital letter I with ogonek&quot; has ISO 8859-2 code point 0xc7 (in hexadecimal) and corresponding Unicode code point of U+012E. Transforming either way between an ISO 8859 set and the corresponding Unicode characters is essentially just a table lookup.\nThe table from ISO 8859 code points to Unicode code points could be done as an array of 256 integers. But many of these will have the same value as the index. So we just use a map of the different ones, and those not in the map take the index value.\nFor ISO 8859-2 a portion of the map is\nvar unicodeToISOMap = map[int] uint8 {\n    0x12e: 0xc7,\n    0x10c: 0xc8,\n    0x118: 0xca,\n    // plus more\n}\n\nand a function to convert UTF-8 strings to an array of ISO 8859-2 bytes is\n/* Turn a UTF-8 string into an ISO 8859 encoded byte array\n*/ \nfunc unicodeStrToISO(str string) []byte {\n        // get the unicode code points\n    codePoints := []int(str)\n\n        // create a byte array of the same length\n    bytes := make([]byte, len(codePoints))\n\n    for n, v := range(codePoints) {\n                // see if the point is in the exception map\n        iso, ok := unicodeToISOMap[v]\n        if !ok {\n                        // just use the value\n            iso = uint8(v)\n        }\n        bytes[n] = iso\n    }\n    return bytes\n}\n\nIn a similar way you can change an array of ISO 8859-2 bytes into a UTF-8 string:\nvar isoToUnicodeMap = map[uint8] int {\n    0xc7: 0x12e, \n    0xc8: 0x10c,\n    0xca: 0x118,\n    // and more\n}\n\nfunc isoBytesToUnicode(bytes []byte) string {\n    codePoints := make([]int, len(bytes))\n    for n, v := range(bytes) {\n        unicode, ok :=isoToUnicodeMap[v]\n        if !ok {\n            unicode = int(v)\n        }\n        codePoints[n] = unicode\n    }\n    return string(codePoints)\n}\n\nThese functions can be used to read and write UTF-8 strings as ISO 8859-2 bytes. By changing the mapping table, you can cover the other ISO 8859 codes. Latin-1, or ISO 8859-1, is a special case - the exception map is empty as the code points for Latin-1 are the same in Unicode. You could also use the same technique for other character sets based on a table mapping, such as Windows 1252. \n"},"encoding/other_character_sets_and_go.html":{"url":"encoding/other_character_sets_and_go.html","title":"Other character sets and Go","body":"Other character sets and Go\n There are very, very many character set encodings. According to Google, these generally only have a small use, which will hopefully decrease even further in time. But if your software wants to capture all markets, then you may need to handle them.\nIn the simplest cases, a lookup table will suffice. But that doesn&#39;t always work. The character coding ISO 2022 minimised character set sizes by using a finite state machine to swap code pages in and out. This was borrowed by some of the Japanese encodings, and makes things very complex.\nGo does not at present give any language or package support for these other character sets. So you either avoid their use, fail to talk to applications that do use them, or write lots of your own code!\nConclusion\nThere hasn&#39;t been much code in this chapter.

Usually this is done by forming a simple number out of the bytes in the data. This process is called hashing and the resulting number is called a hash or hash value.\nA naive hashing algorithm is just to sum up all the bytes in the data. However, this still allows almost any amount of changing the data around and still preserving the hash values. For example, an attacker could just swap two bytes. This preserves the hash value, but could end up with you owing someone $65,536 instead of $256.\nHashing algorithms used for security purposes have to be &quot;strong&quot;, so that it is very difficult for an attacker to find a different sequence of bytes with the same hash value. This makes it hard to modify the data to the attacker&#39;s purposes. Security researchers are constantly testing hash algorithms to see if they can break them - that is, find a simple way of coming up with byte sequences to match a hash value. They have devised a series of cryptographic hashing algorithms which are believed to be strong.\nGo has support for several hashing algorithms, including MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512. They all follow the same pattern as far as the Go programmer is concerned: a function New (or similar) in the appropriate package returns a Hash object from the hash package.\nA Hash has an io.Writer, and you write the data to be hashed to this writer. You can query the number of bytes in the hash value by Size and the hash value by Sum.\nA typical case is MD5 hashing. This uses the md5 package. The hash value is a 16 byte array. This is typically printed out in ASCII form as four hexadecimal numbers, each made of 4 bytes. A simple program is \n/* MD5Hash\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;crypto/md5&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    hash := md5.New()\n    bytes := []byte(&quot;hello\\n&quot;)\n    hash.Write(bytes)\n    hashValue := hash.Sum(nil)\n    hashSize := hash.Size()\n    for n := 0; n &lt; hashSize; n += 4 {\n        var val uint32\n        val = uint32(hashValue[n])&lt;&lt;24 +\n            uint32(hashValue[n+1])&lt;&lt;16 +\n            uint32(hashValue[n+2])&lt;&lt;8 +\n            uint32(hashValue[n+3])\n        fmt.Printf(&quot;%x &quot;, val)\n    }\n    fmt.Println()\n}\n\nwhich prints b1946ac9 2492d234 7c6235b4 d2611184\nA variation on this is the HMAC (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) which adds a key to the hash algorithm. There is little change in using this. To use MD5 hashing along with a key, replace the call to New by\nfunc NewMD5(key []byte) hash.Hash\n\n"},"security/symmetric_key_encryption.html":{"url":"security/symmetric_key_encryption.html","title":"Symmetric key encryption","body":"Symmetric key encryption\nThere are two major mechanisms used for encrypting data. The first uses a single key that is the same for both encryption and decryption. This key needs to be known to both the encrypting and the decrypting agents. How this key is transmitted between the agents is not discussed.\nAs with hashing, there are many encryption algorithms. Many are now known to have weaknesses, and in general algorithms become weaker over time as computers get faster. Go has support for several symmetric key algorithms such as Blowfish and DES.\nThe algorithms are block algorithms. That is they work on blocks of data. If your data is not aligned to the block size, then you will have to pad it with extra blanks at the end.\nEach algorithm is represented by a Cipher object. This is created by NewCipher in the appropriate package, and takes the symmetric key as parameter.\nOnce you have a cipher, you can use it to encrypt and decrypt blocks of data. The blocks have to be 8-byte blocks for Blowfish. A program to illustrate this is \n/* Blowfish\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;bytes&quot;\n    &quot;golang.org/x/crypto/blowfish&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    key := []byte(&quot;my key&quot;)\n    cipher, err := blowfish.NewCipher(key)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err.Error())\n    }\n    src := []byte(&quot;hello\\n\\n\\n&quot;)\n    var enc [512]byte\n\n    cipher.Encrypt(enc[0:], src)\n\n    var decrypt [8]byte\n    cipher.Decrypt(decrypt[0:], enc[0:])\n    result := bytes.NewBuffer(nil)\n    result.Write(decrypt[0:8])\n    fmt.Println(string(result.Bytes()))\n}\n\nBlowfish is not in the Go 1 distribution.

A site may become a Web host by running an HTTP server. While Web clients are typically users with a browser, there are many other &quot;user agents&quot; such as web spiders, web application clients and so on.\nThe Web is built on top of the HTTP (Hyper-Text Transport Protocol) which is layered on top of TCP. HTTP has been through three publicly available versions, but the latest - version 1.1 - is now the most commonly used.\nIn this chapter we give an overview of HTTP, followed by the Go APIs to manage HTTP connections.\n"},"http/overview_of_http.html":{"url":"http/overview_of_http.html","title":"Overview of HTTP","body":"Overview of HTTP\nURLs and resources\nURLs specify the location of a resource. A resource is often a static file, such as an HTML document, an image, or a sound file. But increasingly, it may be a dynamically generated object, perhaps based on information stored in a database.\nWhen a user agent requests a resource, what is returned is not the resource itself, but some representation of that resource. For example, if the resource is a static file, then what is sent to the user agent is a copy of the file.\nMultiple URLs may point to the same resource, and an HTTP server will return appropriate representations of the resource for each URL. For example, an company might make product information available both internally and externally using different URLs for the same product. The internal representation of the product might include information such as internal contact officers for the product, while the external representation might include the location of stores selling the product.\nThis view of resources means that the HTTP protocol can be fairly simple and straightforward, while an HTTP server can be arbitrarily complex. HTTP has to deliver requests from user agents to servers and return a byte stream, while a server might have to do any amount of processing of the request.\nHTTP characteristics\nHTTP is a stateless, connectionless, reliable protocol. In the simplest form, each request from a user agent is handled reliably and then the connection is broken. Each request involves a separate TCP connection, so if many resources are required (such as images embedded in an HTML page) then many TCP connections have to be set up and torn down in a short space of time.\nThere are many optimisations in HTTP which add complexity to the simple structure, in order to create a more efficient and reliable protocol.\nVersions\nThere are 3 versions of HTTP\n\nVersion 0.9 - totally obsolete\nVersion 1.0 - almost obsolete\nVersion 1.1 - current\n\nEach version must understand requests and responses of earlier versions.\nHTTP 0.9\nRequest format\nRequest = Simple-Request\n\nSimple-Request = &quot;GET&quot; SP Request-URI CRLF\nResponse format\nA response is of the form\nResponse = Simple-Response\n\nSimple-Response = [Entity-Body]\nHTTP 1.0\nThis version added much more information to the requests and responses. Rather than &quot;grow&quot; the 0.9 format, it was just left alongside the new version.\nRequest format\nThe format of requests from client to server is\nRequest = Simple-Request | Full-Request\n\nSimple-Request = &quot;GET&quot; SP Request-URI CRLF\n\nFull-Request = Request-Line\n        *(General-Header\n        | Request-Header\n        | Entity-Header)\n        CRLF\n        [Entity-Body]\nA Simple-Request is an HTTP/0.9 request and must be replied to by a Simple-Response.\nA Request-Line has format\nRequest-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF\nwhere\nMethod = &quot;GET&quot; | &quot;HEAD&quot; | POST |\n     extension-method\ne.g. GET http://jan.newmarch.name/index.html HTTP/1.0\nResponse format\nA response is of the form\nResponse = Simple-Response | Full-Response\n\nSimple-Response = [Entity-Body]\n\nFull-Response = Status-Line\n        *(General-Header \n        | Response-Header\n        | Entity-Header)\n        CRLF\n        [Entity-Body]\nThe Status-Line gives information about the fate of the request:\nStatus-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF\ne.g.\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\n\nThe codes are\n\nStatus-Code =      &quot;200&quot; ; OK\n        | &quot;201&quot; ; Created\n        | &quot;202&quot; ; Accepted\n        | &quot;204&quot; ; No Content\n        | &quot;301&quot; ; Moved permanently\n        | &quot;302&quot; ; Moved temporarily\n        | &quot;304&quot; ; Not modified\n        | &quot;400&quot; ; Bad request\n        | &quot;401&quot; ; Unauthorised\n        | &quot;403&quot; ; Forbidden\n        | &quot;404&quot; ; Not found\n        | &quot;500&quot; ; Internal server error\n        | &quot;501&quot; ; Not implemented\n        | &quot;502&quot; ; Bad gateway\n        | &quot;503&quot; | Service unavailable\n        | extension-code\nThe Entity-Header contains useful information about the Entity-Body to follow\nEntity-Header =    Allow\n        | Content-Encoding\n        | Content-Length\n        | Content-Type\n        | Expires\n        | Last-Modified\n        | extension-header\nFor example\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 29 Aug 2003 00:59:56 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.0.40 (Unix)\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 1595\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\nHTTP 1.1\nHTTP 1.1 fixes many problems with HTTP 1.0, but is more complex because of it. This version is done by extending or refining the options available to HTTP 1.0. e.g.\n\nthere are more commands such as TRACE and CONNECT\nyou should use absolute URLs, particularly for connecting by proxies e.g\n\nGET http://www.w3.org/index.html HTTP/1.1\n\nthere are more attributes such as If-Modified-Since, also for use by proxies\n\nThe changes include\n\nhostname identification (allows virtual hosts)\ncontent negotiation (multiple languages)\npersistent connections (reduces TCP overheads - this is very messy)\nchunked transfers\nbyte ranges (request parts of documents)\nproxy support \n\nThe 0.9 protocol took one page. The 1.0 protocol was described in about 20 pages. 1.1 takes 120 pages. \n"},"http/simple_user-agents.html":{"url":"http/simple_user-agents.html","title":"Simple user-agents","body":"Simple user-agents\nUser agents such as browsers make requests and get responses.

The server will deliver the content using some character set encoding, and possibly some transfer encoding. Usually this is a matter of negotiation between user agent and server, but the simple Get command that we are using does not include the user agent component of the negotiation. So the server can send whatever character encoding it wishes.\nAt the time of first writing, I was in China. When I tried this program on www.google.com, Google&#39;s server tried to be helpful by guessing my location and sending me the text in the Chinese character set Big5! How to tell the server what character encoding is okay for me is discussed later. \n"},"http/configuring_http_requests.html":{"url":"http/configuring_http_requests.html","title":"Configuring HTTP requests","body":"Configuring HTTP requests\nGo also supplies a lower-level interface for user agents to communicate with HTTP servers.

This is a complex type, and is given in the Go documentation as\ntype Request struct {\n    Method     string // GET, POST, PUT, etc.\n    RawURL     string // The raw URL given in the request.\n    URL        *URL   // Parsed URL.\n    Proto      string // &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot;\n    ProtoMajor int    // 1\n    ProtoMinor int    // 0\n\n\n    // A header maps request lines to their values.\n    // If the header says\n    //\n    //    accept-encoding: gzip, deflate\n    //    Accept-Language: en-us\n    //    Connection: keep-alive\n    //\n    // then\n    //\n    //    Header = map[string]string{\n    //        &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;: &quot;gzip, deflate&quot;,\n    //        &quot;Accept-Language&quot;: &quot;en-us&quot;,\n    //        &quot;Connection&quot;: &quot;keep-alive&quot;,\n    //    }\n    //\n    // HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive.\n    // The request parser implements this by canonicalizing the\n    // name, making the first character and any characters\n    // following a hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.\n    Header map[string]string\n\n    // The message body.\n    Body io.ReadCloser\n\n    // ContentLength records the length of the associated content.\n    // The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.\n    // Values &gt;= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may be read from Body.\n    ContentLength int64\n\n    // TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to innermost.\n    // An empty list denotes the &quot;identity&quot; encoding.\n    TransferEncoding []string\n\n    // Whether to close the connection after replying to this request.\n    Close bool\n\n    // The host on which the URL is sought.\n    // Per RFC 2616, this is either the value of the Host: header\n    // or the host name given in the URL itself.\n    Host string\n\n    // The referring URL, if sent in the request.\n    //\n    // Referer is misspelled as in the request itself,\n    // a mistake from the earliest days of HTTP.\n    // This value can also be fetched from the Header map\n    // as Header[&quot;Referer&quot;]; the benefit of making it\n    // available as a structure field is that the compiler\n    // can diagnose programs that use the alternate\n    // (correct English) spelling req.Referrer but cannot\n    // diagnose programs that use Header[&quot;Referrer&quot;].\n    Referer string\n\n    // The User-Agent: header string, if sent in the request.\n    UserAgent string\n\n    // The parsed form. Only available after ParseForm is called.\n    Form map[string][]string\n\n    // Trailer maps trailer keys to values.  Like for Header, if the\n    // response has multiple trailer lines with the same key, they will be\n    // concatenated, delimited by commas.\n    Trailer map[string]string\n}\n\nThere is a lot of information that can be stored in a request. You do not need to fill in all fields, only those of interest. The simplest way to create a request with default values is by for example\nrequest, err := http.NewRequest(&quot;GET&quot;, url.String(), nil)\nOnce a request has been created, you can modify fields. For example, to specify that you only wish to receive UTF-8, add an &quot;Accept-Charset&quot; field to a request by\nrequest.Header.Add(&quot;Accept-Charset&quot;, &quot;UTF-8;q=1, ISO-8859-1;q=0&quot;)\n(Note that the default set ISO-8859-1 always gets a value of one unless mentioned explicitly in the list.).\nA client setting a charset request is simple by the above. But there is some confusion about what happens with the server&#39;s return value of a charset. The returned resource should have a Content-Type which will specify the media type of the content such as text/html. If appropriate the media type should state the charset, such as text/html; charset=UTF-8. If there is no charset specification, then according to the HTTP specification it should be treated as the default ISO8859-1 charset. But the HTML 4 specification states that since many servers don&#39;t conform to this, then you can&#39;t make any assumptions.\nIf there is a charset specified in the server&#39;s Content-Type, then assume it is correct. if there is none specified, since 50% of pages are in UTF-8 and 20% are in ASCII then it is safe to assume UTF-8. Only 30% of pages may be wrong :-(. \n"},"http/the_client_object.html":{"url":"http/the_client_object.html","title":"The Client object","body":"The Client object\nTo send a request to a server and get a reply, the convenience object Client is the easiest way.

A &quot;GET&quot; request should be made to a proxy. However, the URL requested should be the full URL of the destination. In addition the HTTP header should contain a &quot;Host&quot; field, set to the proxy. As long as the proxy is configured to pass such requests through, then that is all that needs to be done.\nGo considers this to be part of the HTTP transport layer. To manage this it has a class Transport. This contains a field which can be set to a function that returns a URL for a proxy. If we have a URL as a string for the proxy, the appropriate transport object is created and then given to a client object by\nproxyURL, err := url.Parse(proxyString)\ntransport := &amp;http.Transport{Proxy: http.ProxyURL(proxyURL)}\nclient := &amp;http.Client{Transport: transport}\nThe client can then continue as before.\nThe following program illustrates this:\n/* ProxyGet\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;io&quot;\n    &quot;net/http&quot;\n    &quot;net/http/httputil&quot;\n    &quot;net/url&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) != 3 {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Usage: &quot;, os.Args[0], &quot;http://proxy-host:port http://host:port/page&quot;)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    proxyString := os.Args[1]\n    proxyURL, err := url.Parse(proxyString)\n    checkError(err)\n    rawURL := os.Args[2]\n    url, err := url.Parse(rawURL)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    transport := &amp;http.Transport{Proxy: http.ProxyURL(proxyURL)}\n    client := &amp;http.Client{Transport: transport}\n\n    request, err := http.NewRequest(&quot;GET&quot;, url.String(), nil)\n\n    dump, _ := httputil.DumpRequest(request, false)\n    fmt.Println(string(dump))\n\n    response, err := client.Do(request)\n\n    checkError(err)\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Read ok&quot;)\n\n    if response.Status != &quot;200 OK&quot; {\n        fmt.Println(response.Status)\n        os.Exit(2)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Reponse ok&quot;)\n\n    var buf [512]byte\n    reader := response.Body\n    for {\n        n, err := reader.Read(buf[0:])\n        if err != nil {\n            os.Exit(0)\n        }\n        fmt.Print(string(buf[0:n]))\n    }\n\n    os.Exit(0)\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        if err == io.EOF {\n            return\n        }\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Fatal error &quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nIf you have a proxy at, say, XYZ.com on port 8080, test this by\ngo run ProxyGet.go http://XYZ.com:8080/ http://www.google.com\nIf you don&#39;t have a suitable proxy to test this, then download and install the Squid proxy to your own computer.\nThe above program used a known proxy passed as an argument to the program. There are many ways in which proxies can be made known to applications. Most browsers have a configuration menu in which you can enter proxy information: such information is not available to a Go application. Some applications may get proxy information from an autoproxy.pac file somewhere in your network: Go does not (yet) know how to parse these JavaScript files and so cannot use them. Linux systems using Gnome have a configuration system called gconf in which proxy information can be stored: Go cannot access this. But it can find proxy information if it is set in operating system environment variables such as HTTP_PROXY or http_proxy using the function\nfunc ProxyFromEnvironment(req *Request) (*url.URL, error)\n\nIf your programs are running in such an environment you can use this function instead of having to explicitly know the proxy parameters.\nAuthenticating proxy\nSome proxies will require authentication, by a user name and password in order to pass requests. A common scheme is &quot;basic authentication&quot; in which the user name and password are concatenated into a string &quot;user:password&quot; and then BASE64 encoded. This is then given to the proxy by the HTTP request header &quot;Proxy-Authorisation&quot; with the flag that it is the basic authentication\nThe following program illustrates this, adding the Proxy-Authentication header to the previous proxy program:\n/* ProxyAuthGet\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;encoding/base64&quot;\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;io&quot;\n    &quot;net/http&quot;\n    &quot;net/http/httputil&quot;\n    &quot;net/url&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n)\n\nconst auth = &quot;jannewmarch:mypassword&quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) != 3 {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Usage: &quot;, os.Args[0], &quot;http://proxy-host:port http://host:port/page&quot;)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    proxy := os.Args[1]\n    proxyURL, err := url.Parse(proxy)\n    checkError(err)\n    rawURL := os.Args[2]\n    url, err := url.Parse(rawURL)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    // encode the auth\n    basic := &quot;Basic &quot; + base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(auth))\n\n    transport := &amp;http.Transport{Proxy: http.ProxyURL(proxyURL)}\n    client := &amp;http.Client{Transport: transport}\n\n    request, err := http.NewRequest(&quot;GET&quot;, url.String(), nil)\n\n    request.Header.Add(&quot;Proxy-Authorization&quot;, basic)\n    dump, _ := httputil.DumpRequest(request, false)\n    fmt.Println(string(dump))\n\n    // send the request\n    response, err := client.Do(request)\n\n    checkError(err)\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Read ok&quot;)\n\n    if response.Status != &quot;200 OK&quot; {\n        fmt.Println(response.Status)\n        os.Exit(2)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Reponse ok&quot;)\n\n    var buf [512]byte\n    reader := response.Body\n    for {\n        n, err := reader.Read(buf[0:])\n        if err != nil {\n            os.Exit(0)\n        }\n        fmt.Print(string(buf[0:n]))\n    }\n\n    os.Exit(0)\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        if err == io.EOF {\n            return\n        }\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Fatal error &quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\n"},"http/https_connections_by_clients.html":{"url":"http/https_connections_by_clients.html","title":"HTTPS connections by clients","body":"HTTPS connections by clients\nFor secure, encrypted connections, HTTP uses TLS which is described in the chapter on security. The protocol of HTTP+TLS is called HTTPS and uses https:// urls instead of http:// urls.\nServers are required to return valid X.509 certificates before a client will accept data from them. If the certificate is valid, then Go handles everything under the hood and the clients given previously run okay with https URLs.\nMany sites have invalid certificates. They may have expired, they may be self-signed instead of by a recognised Certificate Authority or they may just have errors (such as having an incorrect server name). Browsers such as Firefox put a big warning notice with a &quot;Get me out of here!&quot; button, but you can carry on at your risk - which many people do.\nGo presently bails out when it encounters certificate errors. There is cautious support for carrying on but I haven&#39;t got it working yet. So there is no current example for &quot;carrying on in the face of adversity :-)&quot;. Maybe later. \n"},"http/servers.html":{"url":"http/servers.html","title":"Servers","body":"Servers\nThe other side to building a client is a Web server handling HTTP requests. The simplest - and earliest - servers just returned copies of files. However, any URL can now trigger an arbitrary computation in current servers.\nFile server\nWe start with a basic file server. Go supplies a multi-plexer, that is, an object that will read and interpret requests. It hands out requests to handlers which run in their own thread. Thus much of the work of reading HTTP requests, decoding them and branching to suitable functions in their own thread is done for us.\nFor a file server, Go also gives a FileServer object which knows how to deliver files from the local file system. It takes a &quot;root&quot; directory which is the top of a file tree in the local system, and a pattern to match URLs against. The simplest pattern is &quot;/&quot; which is the top of any URL. This will match all URLs.\nAn HTTP server delivering files from the local file system is almost embarrassingly trivial given these objects. It is\n/* File Server\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;net/http&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // deliver files from the directory /var/www \n    //fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir(&quot;/var/www&quot;))\n    fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir(&quot;/home/httpd/html/&quot;))\n\n    // register the handler and deliver requests to it\n    err := http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8000&quot;, fileServer)\n    checkError(err)\n    // That&#39;s it!\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Fatal error &quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nThis server even delivers &quot;404 not found&quot; messages for requests for file resources that don&#39;t exist!\nHandler functions\nIn this last program, the handler was given in the second argument to ListenAndServe. Any number of handlers can be registered first by calls to Handle or HandleFunc, with signatures\nfunc Handle(pattern string, handler Handler)\nfunc HandleFunc(pattern string, handler func(*Conn, *Request))\n\nThe second argument to HandleAndServe could be nil, and then calls are dispatched to all registered handlers. Each handler should have a different URL pattern. For example, the file handler might have URL pattern &quot;/&quot; while a function handler might have URL pattern &quot;/cgi-bin&quot;. A more specific pattern takes precedence over a more general pattern.\nCommon CGI programs are test-cgi (written in the shell) or printenv (written in Perl) which print the values of the environment variables. A handler can be written to work in a similar manner.\n/* Print Env\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;net/http&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // file handler for most files\n    fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir(&quot;/var/www&quot;))\n    http.Handle(&quot;/&quot;, fileServer)\n\n    // function handler for /cgi-bin/printenv\n    http.HandleFunc(&quot;/cgi-bin/printenv&quot;, printEnv)\n\n    // deliver requests to the handlers\n    err := http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8000&quot;, nil)\n    checkError(err)\n    // That&#39;s it!\n}\n\nfunc printEnv(writer http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n    env := os.Environ()\n    writer.Write([]byte(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Environment&lt;/h1&gt;\\n&lt;pre&gt;&quot;))\n    for _, v := range env {\n        writer.Write([]byte(v + &quot;\\n&quot;))\n    }\n    writer.Write([]byte(&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&quot;))\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Fatal error &quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nNote: for simplicity this program does not deliver well-formed HTML. It is missing html, head and body tags.\nUsing the cgi-bin directory in this program is a bit cheeky: it doesn&#39;t call an external program like CGI scripts do. It just calls a Go function. Go does have the ability to call external programs using os.ForkExec, but does not yet have support for dynamically linkable modules like Apache&#39;s mod_perl. \nBypassing the default multiplexer\nHTTP requests received by a Go server are usually handled by a multiplexer the examines the path in the HTTP request and calls the appropriate file handler, etc. You can define your own handlers. These can either be registered with the default multiplexer by calling http.HandleFunc which takes a pattern and a function. The functions such as ListenAndServe then take a nil handler function. This was done in the last example.\nIf you want to take over the multiplexer role then you can give a non-zero function as the handler function. This function will then be totally responsible for managing the requests and responses.\nThe following example is trivial, but illustrates the use of this: the multiplexer function simply returns a &quot;204 No content&quot; for all requests:\n/* ServerHandler\n */\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;net/http&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    myHandler := http.HandlerFunc(func(rw http.ResponseWriter, request *http.Request) {\n        // Just return no content - arbitrary headers can be set, arbitrary body\n        rw.WriteHeader(http.StatusNoContent)\n    })\n\n    http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8080&quot;, myHandler)\n}\n\nArbitrarily complex behaviour can be built, of course. \nLow-level servers\nGo also supplies a lower-level interface for servers. Again, this means that as the programmer you have to do more work. You first make a TCP server, and then wrap a ServerConn around it. Then you read Request&#39;s and write Response&#39;s.\nConclusion\nGo has extensive support for HTTP. This is not surprising, since Go was partly invented to fill a need by Google for their own servers.\n"},"templates/":{"url":"templates/","title":"Templates","body":"Chapter 9 Templates\nMany languages have mechanisms to convert strings from one to another. Go has a template mechanism to convert strings based on the content of an object supplied as an argument. While this is often used in rewriting HTML to insert object values, it can be used in other situations. Note that this material doesn&#39;t have anything explicitly to do with networking, but may be useful to network programs. \nIntroduction\nMost server-side languages have a mechanism for taking predominantly static pages and inserting a dynamically generated component, such as a list of items. Typical examples are scripts in Java Server Pages, PHP scripting and many others. Go has adopted a relatively simple scripting language in the template package.\nWe describe the new package here. The package is designed to take text as input and output different text, based on transforming the original text using the values of an object. Unlike JSP or similar, it is not restricted to HTML files but it is likely to find greatest use there.\nThe original source is called a template and will consist of text that is transmitted unchanged, and embedded commands which can act on and change text. The commands are delimited by {{ ... }} , similar to the JSP commands &lt;%= ... =%&gt; and PHPs &lt;?php ... ?&gt;. \n"},"templates/inserting_object_values.html":{"url":"templates/inserting_object_values.html","title":"Inserting object values","body":"Inserting object values\nA template is applied to a Go object. Fields from that Go object can be inserted into the template, and you can &#39;dig&#39; into the object to find subfields, etc. The current object is represented as &#39;.&#39;, so that to insert the value of the current object as a string, you use {{.}}. The package uses the fmt package by default to work out the string used as inserted values.\nTo insert the value of a field of the current object, you use the field name prefixed by &#39;.&#39;. For example, if the object is of type\ntype Person struct {\n        Name      string\n        Age       int\n        Emails     []string\n        Jobs       []*Jobs\n}\n\nthen you insert the values of Name and Age by\nThe name is {{.Name}}.\nThe age is {{.Age}}.\nWe can loop over the elements of an array or other list using the range command. So to access the contents of the Emails array we do\n{{range .Emails}}\n        ...\n{{end}}\nif Job is defined by\ntype Job struct {\n    Employer string\n    Role     string\n}\n\nand we want to access the fields of a Person&#39;s Jobs, we can do it as above with a {{range .Jobs}}. An alternative is to switch the current object to the Jobs field. This is done using the {{with ...}} ... {{end}} construction, where now {{.}} is the Jobs field, which is an array:\n{{with .Jobs}}\n    {{range .}}\n        An employer is {{.Employer}}\n        and the role is {{.Role}}\n    {{end}}\n{{end}}\nYou can use this with any field, not just an array. Using templates\nOnce we have a template, we can apply it to an object to generate a new string, using the object to fill in the template values. This is a two-step process which involves parsing the template and then applying it to an object.

If we wish to reduce this, eliminate newlines in the template as in\n{{range .Emails}} An email is {{.}} {{end}}\nIn the example, we used a string in the program as the template. You can also load templates from a file using the function template.ParseFiles(). For some reason that I don&#39;t understand (and which wasn&#39;t required in earlier versions), the name assigned to the template must be the same as the basename of the first file in the list of files. Is this a bug? \n"},"templates/pipelines.html":{"url":"templates/pipelines.html","title":"Pipelines","body":"Pipelines\nThe above transformations insert pieces of text into a template. Those pieces of text are essentially arbitrary, whatever the string values of the fields are. If we want them to appear as part of an HTML document (or other specialised form) then we will have to escape particular sequences of characters. For example, to display arbitrary text in an HTML document we have to change &quot;&lt;&quot; to &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;. The Go templates have a number of builtin functions, and one of these is the function html. These functions act in a similar manner to Unix pipelines, reading from standard input and writing to standard output.\nTo take the value of the current object &#39;.&#39; and apply HTML escapes to it, you write a &quot;pipeline&quot; in the template\n{{. | html}}\nand similarly for other functions.\nMike Samuel has pointed out a convenience function currently in the exp/template/html package. If all of the entries in a template need to be passed through the html template function, then the Go function Escape(t *template.Template) can take a template and add the html function to each node in the template that doesn&#39;t already have one. This will be useful for templates used for HTML documents and can form a pattern for similar function uses elsewhere. \n"},"templates/defining_functions.html":{"url":"templates/defining_functions.html","title":"Defining functions","body":"Defining functions\nThe templates use the string representation of an object to insert values, using the fmt package to convert the object to a string. Sometimes this isn&#39;t what is needed. For example, to avoid spammers getting hold of email addresses it is quite common to see the symbol &#39;@&#39; replaced by the word &quot; at &quot;, as in &quot;jan at newmarch.name&quot;. If we want to use a template to display email addresses in that form, then we have to build a custom function to do this transformation.\nEach template function has a name that is used in the templates themselves, and an associated Go function. These are linked by the type\ntype FuncMap map[string]interface{}\n\nFor example, if we want our template function to be &quot;emailExpand&quot; which is linked to the Go function EmailExpander then we add this to the functions in a template by\nt = t.Funcs(template.FuncMap{&quot;emailExpand&quot;: EmailExpander})\n\nThe signature for EmailExpander is typically\nfunc EmailExpander(args ...interface{}) string\n\nIn the use we are interested in, there should only be one argument to the function which will be a string. Existing functions in the Go template library have some initial code to handle non-conforming cases, so we just copy that. Then it is just simple string manipulation to change the format of the email address.

Let&#39;s consider a case where it is almost right but not quite. There is a JSON package to serialise objects, which we looked at in Chapter 4. This would produce\n{&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;jan&quot;,\n &quot;Emails&quot;: [&quot;jan@newmarch.name&quot;, &quot;jan.newmarch@gmail.com&quot;]\n}\nThe JSON package is the one you would use in practice, but let&#39;s see if we can produce JSON output using templates. We can do something similar just by the templates we have. This is almost right as a JSON serialiser:\n{&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;{{.Name}}&quot;,\n &quot;Emails&quot;: {{.Emails}}\n}\nIt will produce\n{&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;jan&quot;,\n &quot;Emails&quot;: [jan@newmarch.name jan.newmarch@gmail.com]\n}\nwhich has two problems: the addresses aren&#39;t in quotes, and the list elements should be &#39;,&#39; separated.\nHow about this: looking at the array elements, putting them in quotes and adding commas?\n{&quot;Name&quot;: {{.Name}},\n  &quot;Emails&quot;: [\n   {{range .Emails}}\n      &quot;{{.}}&quot;,\n   {{end}}\n  ]\n}\nwhich will produce\n{&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;jan&quot;,\n &quot;Emails&quot;: [&quot;jan@newmarch.name&quot;, &quot;jan.newmarch@gmail.com&quot;,]\n}\n(plus some white space.).\nAgain, almost correct, but if you look carefully, you will see a trailing &#39;,&#39; after the last list element. According to the JSON syntax (see json.org, this trailing &#39;,&#39; is not allowed. Implementations may vary in how they deal with this.\nWhat we want is &quot;print every element followed by a &#39;,&#39; except for the last one. This is actually a bit hard to do, so a better way is &quot;print every element preceded by a &#39;,&#39; except for the first one. (I got this tip from &quot;brianb&quot; at Stack Overflow.). This is easier, because the first element has index zero and many programming languages, including the Go template language, treat zero as Boolean false.\nOne form of the conditional statement is {{if pipeline}} T1 {{else}} T0 {{end}}. We need the pipeline to be the index into the array of emails. Fortunately, a variation on the range statement gives us this. There are two forms which introduce variables\n{{range $elmt := array}}\n{{range $index, $elmt := array}}\nSo we set up a loop through the array, and if the index is false (0) we just print the element, otherwise print it preceded by a &#39;,&#39;.

Rather, after many years of trying I am still attempting to learn Chinese. Of course, rather than buckling down and getting on with it, I have tried all sorts of technical aids. I tried DVDs, videos, flashcards and so on. Eventually I realised that there wasn&#39;t a good computer program for Chinese flashcards, and so in the interests of learning, I needed to build one.\nI had found a program in Python to do some of the task. But sad to say it wasn&#39;t well written and after a few attempts at turning it upside down and inside out I came to the conclusion that it was better to start from scratch. Of course, a Web solution would be far better than a standalone one, because then all the other people in my Chinese class could share it, as well as any other learners out there. And of course, the server would be written in Go.\nThe flashcards server is running at cict.bhtafe.edu.au:8000. The front page consists of a list of flashcard sets currently available, how you want a set displayed (random card order, Chinese, English or random), whether to display a set, add to it, etc. I&#39;ve spent too much time building it - somehow my Chinese hasn&#39;t progressed much while I was doing it... It probably won&#39;t be too exciting as a program if you don&#39;t want to learn Chinese, but let&#39;s get into the structure. \n"},"webserver/static_pages.html":{"url":"webserver/static_pages.html","title":"Static pages","body":"Static pages\n Some pages will just have static content.

The written form is hieroglyphic, that is &quot;pictograms&quot; instead of using an alphabet. But this written form has evolved over time, and even recently split into two forms: &quot;traditional&quot; Chinese as used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and &quot;simplified&quot; Chinese as used in mainland China. While most of the characters are the same, about 1,000 are different. Thus a Chinese dictionary will often have two written forms of the same character.\nMost Westerners like me can&#39;t understand these characters. So there is a &quot;Latinised&quot; form called Pinyin which writes the characters in a phonetic alphabet based on the Latin alphabet. It isn&#39;t quite the Latin alphabet, because Chinese is a tonal language, and the Pinyin form has to show the tones (much like acccents in French and other European languages). So a typical dictionary has to show four things: the traditional form, the simplified form, the Pinyin and the English. For example,\n\n\n\nTraditional\nSimplified\nPinyin\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n好\n好\nhǎo\ngood\n\n\n\nBut again there is a little complication. There is a free Chinese/English dictionary and even better, you can download it as a UTF-8 file, which Go is well suited to handle. In this, the Chinese characters are written in Unicode but the Pinyin characters are not: although there are Unicode characters for letters such as &#39;ǎ&#39;, many dictionaries including this one use the Latin &#39;a&#39; and place the tone at the end of the word. Here it is the third tone, so &quot;hǎo&quot; is written as &quot;hao3&quot;. This makes it easier for those who only have US keyboards and no Unicode editor to still communicate in Pinyin.\nThis data format mismatch is not a big deal: just that somewhere along the line, between the original text dictionary and the display in the browser, a data massage has to be performed. Go templates allow this to be done by defining a custom template, so I chose that route. Alternatives could have been to do this as the dictionary is read in, or in the Javascript to display the final characters.\nThe code for the Pinyin formatter is given below.

This is called in response to an HTML Form request to find the English words in a dictionary.\nfunc lookupWord(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n        word := req.FormValue(&quot;word&quot;)\n        words := d.LookupEnglish(word)\n\n        pinyinMap := template.FormatterMap {&quot;pinyin&quot;: pinyin.PinyinFormatter}\n        t, err := template.ParseFile(&quot;html/DictionaryEntry.html&quot;, pinyinMap)\n        if err != nil {\n                http.Error(rw, err.String(), http.StatusInternalServerError)\n                return\n        }\n        t.Execute(rw, words)\n}\n\nThe HTML code is\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Word&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Traditional&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Simplified&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Pinyin&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;English&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\n      {{with .Entries}}\n      {{range .}}\n      {.repeated section Entries}\n      &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{.Word}}&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{.Traditional}}&lt;/td&gt; \n    &lt;td&gt;{{.Simplified}}&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{.Pinyin|pinyin}}&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;pre&gt;\n        {.repeated section Translations} \n        {@|html} \n        {.end}\n      &lt;/pre&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\n      {.end} \n      {{end}}\n      {{end}}\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nThe Dictionary type\nThe text file containing the dictionary has lines of the form \ntraditional simplified [pinyin] /translation/translation/.../\nFor example,\n好 好 [hao3] /good/well/proper/good to/easy to/very/so/(suffix indicating completion or readiness)/\nWe store each line as an Entry within the Dictionary package:\ntype Entry struct {\n    Traditional string\n    Simplified string\n    Pinyin     string\n    Translations []string\n}\n\nThe dictionary itself is just an array of these entries:\ntype Dictionary struct {\n    Entries []*Entry\n}\n\nBuilding the dictionary is easy enough. Just read each line and break the line into its various bits using simple string methods. Then add the line to the dictionary slice.\nLooking up entries in this dictionary is straightforward: just search through until we find the appropriate key. There are about 100,000 entries in this dictionary: brute force by a linear search is fast enough. If it were necessary, faster storage and search mechanisms could easily be used.\nThe original dictionary grows by people on the Web adding in entries as they see fit. Consequently it isn&#39;t that well organised and contains repetitions and multiple entries. So looking up any word - either by Pinyin or by English - may return multiple matches. To cater for this, each lookup returns a &quot;mini dictionary&quot;, just those lines in the full dictionary that match.\nThe Dictionary code is\npackage dictionary\n\nimport (\n    &quot;bufio&quot;\n    //&quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;strings&quot;\n)\n\ntype Entry struct {\n    Traditional  string\n    Simplified   string\n    Pinyin       string\n    Translations []string\n}\n\nfunc (de Entry) String() string {\n    str := de.Traditional + ` ` + de.Simplified + ` ` + de.Pinyin\n    for _, t := range de.Translations {\n        str = str + &quot;\\n    &quot; + t\n    }\n    return str\n}\n\ntype Dictionary struct {\n    Entries []*Entry\n}\n\nfunc (d *Dictionary) String() string {\n    str := &quot;&quot;\n    for n := 0; n &lt; len(d.Entries); n++ {\n        de := d.Entries[n]\n        str += de.String() + &quot;\\n&quot;\n    }\n    return str\n}\n\nfunc (d *Dictionary) LookupPinyin(py string) *Dictionary {\n    newD := new(Dictionary)\n    v := make([]*Entry, 0, 100)\n    for n := 0; n &lt; len(d.Entries); n++ {\n        de := d.Entries[n]\n        if de.Pinyin == py {\n            v = append(v, de)\n        }\n    }\n    newD.Entries = v\n    return newD\n}\n\nfunc (d *Dictionary) LookupEnglish(eng string) *Dictionary {\n    newD := new(Dictionary)\n    v := make([]*Entry, 0, 100)\n    for n := 0; n &lt; len(d.Entries); n++ {\n        de := d.Entries[n]\n        for _, e := range de.Translations {\n            if e == eng {\n                v = append(v, de)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    newD.Entries = v\n    return newD\n}\n\nfunc (d *Dictionary) LookupSimplified(simp string) *Dictionary {\n    newD := new(Dictionary)\n    v := make([]*Entry, 0, 100)\n\n    for n := 0; n &lt; len(d.Entries); n++ {\n        de := d.Entries[n]\n        if de.Simplified == simp {\n            v = append(v, de)\n        }\n    }\n    newD.Entries = v\n    return newD\n}\n\nfunc (d *Dictionary) Load(path string) {\n\n    f, err := os.Open(path)\n    r := bufio.NewReader(f)\n    if err != nil {\n        println(err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n\n    v := make([]*Entry, 0, 100000)\n    numEntries := 0\n    for {\n        line, err := r.ReadString(&#39;\\n&#39;)\n        if err != nil {\n            break\n        }\n        if line[0] == &#39;#&#39; {\n            continue\n        }\n        // fmt.Println(line)\n        trad, simp, pinyin, translations := parseDictEntry(line)\n\n        de := Entry{\n            Traditional:  trad,\n            Simplified:   simp,\n            Pinyin:       pinyin,\n            Translations: translations}\n\n        v = append(v, &amp;de)\n        numEntries++\n    }\n    // fmt.Printf(&quot;Num entries %d\\n&quot;, numEntries)\n    d.Entries = v\n}\n\nfunc parseDictEntry(line string) (string, string, string, []string) {\n    // format is\n    //    trad simp [pinyin] /trans/trans/.../\n    tradEnd := strings.Index(line, &quot; &quot;)\n    trad := line[0:tradEnd]\n    line = strings.TrimSpace(line[tradEnd:])\n\n    simpEnd := strings.Index(line, &quot; &quot;)\n    simp := line[0:simpEnd]\n    line = strings.TrimSpace(line[simpEnd:])\n\n    pinyinEnd := strings.Index(line, &quot;]&quot;)\n    pinyin := line[1:pinyinEnd]\n    line = strings.TrimSpace(line[pinyinEnd+1:])\n\n    translations := strings.Split(line, &quot;/&quot;)\n    // includes empty at start and end, so\n    translations = translations[1 : len(translations)-1]\n\n    return trad, simp, pinyin, translations\n}\n\n"},"webserver/flash_cards.html":{"url":"webserver/flash_cards.html","title":"Flash cards","body":"Flash cards\nEach individual flash card is of the type Flashcard\ntype FlashCard struct {\n    Simplified string\n    English    string\n    Dictionary *dictionary.Dictionary\n}\n\nAt present we only store the simplified character and the English translation for that character.

Go has basic support for XML document processing.\nIntroduction\n XML is now a widespread way of representing complex data structures serialised into text format. It is used to describe documents such as DocBook and XHTML. It is used in specialised markup languages such as MathML and CML (Chemistry Markup Language). It is used to encode data as SOAP messages for Web Services, and the Web Service can be specified using WSDL (Web Services Description Language).\nAt the simplest level, XML allows you to define your own tags for use in text documents. Tags can be nested and can be interspersed with text. Each tag can also contain attributes with values. For example,\n&lt;person&gt;\n  &lt;name&gt;\n    &lt;family&gt; Newmarch &lt;/family&gt;\n    &lt;personal&gt; Jan &lt;/personal&gt;\n  &lt;/name&gt;\n  &lt;email type=&quot;personal&quot;&gt;\n    jan@newmarch.name\n  &lt;/email&gt;\n  &lt;email type=&quot;work&quot;&gt;\n    j.newmarch@boxhill.edu.au\n  &lt;/email&gt;\n&lt;/person&gt;\n\nThe structure of any XML document can be described in a number of ways:\n\nA document type definition DTD is good for describing structure\nXML schema are good for describing the data types used by an XML document\nRELAX NG is proposed as an alternative to both\n\nThere is argument over the relative value of each way of defining the structure of an XML document. We won&#39;t buy into that, as Go does not suport any of them. Go cannot check for validity of any document against a schema, but only for well-formedness.\nFour topics are discussed in this chapter: parsing an XML stream, marshalling and unmarshalling Go data into XML, and XHTML. \n"},"xml/parsing_xml.html":{"url":"xml/parsing_xml.html","title":"Parsing XML","body":"Parsing XML\nGo has an XML parser which is created using NewParser.

It re-uses space for strings, so that once you see a token you need to copy its value if you want to refer to it later. Go has methods such as \nfunc (c CharData) Copy() CharData to make a copy of data. \n"},"xml/unmarshalling_xml.html":{"url":"xml/unmarshalling_xml.html","title":"Unmarshalling XML","body":"Unmarshalling XML\nGo provides a function Unmarshal and a method func (*Parser) Unmarshal to unmarshal XML into Go data structures. The unmarshalling is not perfect: Go and XML are different languages.\nWe consider a simple example before looking at the details. We take the XML document given earlier of\n&lt;person&gt;\n  &lt;name&gt;\n    &lt;family&gt; Newmarch &lt;/family&gt;\n    &lt;personal&gt; Jan &lt;/personal&gt;\n  &lt;/name&gt;\n  &lt;email type=&quot;personal&quot;&gt;\n    jan@newmarch.name\n  &lt;/email&gt;\n  &lt;email type=&quot;work&quot;&gt;\n    j.newmarch@boxhill.edu.au\n  &lt;/email&gt;\n&lt;/person&gt;\n\nWe would like to map this onto the Go structures\ntype Person struct {\n    Name Name\n    Email []Email\n}\n\ntype Name struct {\n    Family string\n    Personal string\n}\n\ntype Email struct {\n    Type string\n    Address string\n}\n\nThis requires several comments:\n\nUnmarshalling uses the Go reflection package. This requires that all fields by public i.e. start with a capital letter. Earlier versions of Go used case-insensitive matching to match fields such as the XML string &quot;name&quot; to the field Name. Now, though, case-sensitive matching is used. To perform a match, the structure fields must be tagged to show the XML string that will be matched against. This changes Person to\n\ntype Person struct {\n    Name Name `xml:&quot;name&quot;`\n    Email []Email `xml:&quot;email&quot;`\n}\n\n\nWhile tagging of fields can attach XML strings to fields, it can&#39;t do so with the names of the structures. An additional field is required, with field name &quot;XMLName&quot;. This only affects the top-level struct, Person\n\ntype Person struct {\n    XMLName Name `xml:&quot;person&quot;`\n    Name Name `xml:&quot;name&quot;`\n    Email []Email `xml:&quot;email&quot;`\n}\n\n\nRepeated tags in the map to a slice in Go\n\nAttributes within tags will match to fields in a structure only if the Go field has the tag &quot;,attr&quot;. This occurs with the field Type of Email, where matching the attribute &quot;type&quot; of the &quot;email&quot; tag requires `xml:&quot;type,attr&quot;` \n\nIf an XML tag has no attributes and only has character data, then it matches a string field by the same name (case-sensitive, though).

A client sends a message to a server which usually sends a message back. Both sides ae responsible for creating messages in a format understood by both sides, and in reading the data out of those messages.\nHowever, most standalone applications do not make so much use of message passing techniques. Generally the preferred mechanism is that of the function (or method or procedure) call. In this style, a program will call a function with a list of parameters, and on completion of the function call will have a set of return values. These values may be the function value, or if addresses have been passed as parameters then the contents of those addresses might have been changed.\nThe remote procedure call is an attempt to bring this style of programming into the network world. Thus a client will make what looks to it like a normal procedure call. The client-side will package this into a network message and transfer it to the server. The server will unpack this and turn it back into a procedure call on the server side. The results of this call will be packaged up for return to the client.\nDiagrammatically it looks like \n\nwhere the steps are\n\nThe client calls the local stub procedure. The stub packages up the parameters into a network message. This is called marshalling.\nNetworking functions in the O/S kernel are called by the stub to send the message.\nThe kernel sends the message(s) to the remote system. This may be connection-oriented or connectionless.\nA server stub unmarshalls the arguments from the network message.\nThe server stub executes a local procedure call.\nThe procedure completes, returning execution to the server stub.\nThe server stub marshals the return values into a network message.\nThe return messages are sent back.\nThe client stub reads the messages using the network functions.\nThe message is unmarshalled. and the return values are set on the stack for the local process.\n\nThere are two common styles for implementing RPC. The first is typified by Sun&#39;s RPC/ONC and by CORBA. In this, a specification of the service is given in some abstract language such as CORBA IDL (interface definition language). This is then compiled into code for the client and for the server. The client then writes a normal program containing calls to a procedure/function/method which is linked to the generated client-side code. The server-side code is actually a server itself, which is linked to the procedure implementation that you write.\nIn this way, the client-side code is almost identical in appearance to a normal procedure call. Generally there is a little extra code to locate the server. In Sun&#39;s ONC, the address of the server must be known; in CORBA a naming service is called to find the address of the server; In Java RMI, the IDL is Java itself and a naming service is used to find the address of the service.\nIn the second style, you have to make use of a special client API. You hand the function name and its parameters to this library on the client side. On the server side, you have to explicitly write the server yourself, as well as the remote procedure implementation.\nThis approach is used by many RPC systems, such as Web Services. It is also the approach used by Go&#39;s RPC. \n"},"rpc/go_rpc.html":{"url":"rpc/go_rpc.html","title":"Go RPC","body":"Go RPC\nGo&#39;s RPC is so far unique to Go. It is different to the other RPC systems, so a Go client will only talk to a Go server. It uses the Gob serialisation system discussed in &quot;Chapter 4 Data serialisation - The gob package&quot;, which defines the data types which can be used.\nRPC systems generally make some restrictions on the functions that can be called across the network. This is so that the RPC system can properly determine what are value arguments to be sent, what are reference arguments to receive answers, and how to signal errors.\nIn Go, the restriction is that\n\nthe function must be public (begin with a capital letter);\nhave exactly two arguments, the first is a pointer to value data to be received by the function from the client, and the second is a pointer to hold the answers to be returned to the client; and\nhave a return value of type error\n\nFor example, a valid function is\nF(&amp;T1, &amp;T2) error\nThe restriction on arguments means that you typically have to define a structure type. Go&#39;s RPC uses the gob package for marshalling and unmarshalling data, so the argument types have to follow the rules of gob as discussed in an earlier chapter.\nWe shall follow the example given in the Go documentation, as this illustrates the important points. The server performs two operations which are trivial - they do not require the &quot;grunt&quot; of RPC, but are simple to understand. The two operations are to multiply two integers, and the second is to find the quotient and remainder after dividing the first by the second.\nThe two values to be manipulated are given in a structure:\ntype Args struct {\n    A, B int\n}\n\nThe sum is just an int, while the quotient/remainder is another structure\ntype Quotient struct {\n    Quo, Rem int\n}\n\nWe will have two functions, multiply and divide to be callable on the RPC server. These functions will need to be registered with the RPC system. The function Register takes a single parameter, which is an interface. So we need a type with these two functions:\ntype Arith int\n\nfunc (t *Arith) Multiply(args *Args, reply *int) error {\n    *reply = args.A * args.B\n    return nil\n}\n\nfunc (t *Arith) Divide(args *Args, quo *Quotient) error {\n    if args.B == 0 {\n        return error.String(&quot;divide by zero&quot;)\n    }\n    quo.Quo = args.A / args.B\n    quo.Rem = args.A % args.B\n    return nil\n}\n\nThe underlying type of Arith is given as int. That doesn&#39;t matter - any type could have done.\nAn object of this type can now be registered using Register, and then its methods can be called by the RPC system.\nHTTP RPC Server\nAny RPC needs a transport mechanism to get messages across the network. Go can use HTTP or TCP. The advantage of the HTTP mechanism is that it can leverage off the HTTP suport library. You need to add an RPC handler to the HTTP layer which is done using HandleHTTP and then start an HTTP server.

If we change the structure in the client to be, say,\ntype Values struct {\n    C, B int\n}\n\nthen gob has no problems: on the server-side the unmarshalling will ignore the value of C given by the client, and use the default zero value for A.\nUsing Go RPC will require a rigid enforcement of the stability of field names and types by the programmer.

While it was in earlier versions of Go, it is not in Go 1. It is available in the old/netchan package if you still need it. This chapter describes this old version. Do not use it for new code.\nIntroduction\nThere are many models for sharing information between communicating processes. One of the more elegant is Here&#39;s concept of channels. In this, there is no shared memory, so that none of the issues of accessing common memory arise. Instead, one process will send a message along a channel to another process. Channels may be synchronous, or asynchronous, buffered or unbuffered.\nGo has channels as first order data types in the language. The canonical example of using channels is Erastophene&#39;s prime sieve: one goroutine generates integers from 2 upwards. These are pumped into a series of channels that act as sieves. Each filter is distinguished by a different prime, and it removes from its stream each number that is divisible by its prime. So the &#39;2&#39; goroutine filters out even numbers, while the &#39;3&#39; goroutine filters out multiples of 3. The first number that comes out of the current set of filters must be a new prime, and this is used to start a new filter with a new channel.\nThe efficacy of many thousands of goroutines communicating by many thousands of channels depends on how well the implementation of these primitives is done. Go is designed to optimise these, so this type of program is feasible.\nGo also supports distributed channels using the netchan package. But network communications are thousands of times slower than channel communications on a single computer. Running a sieve on a network over TCP would be ludicrously slow. Nevertheless, it gives a programming option that may be useful in many situations.\nGo&#39;s network channel model is somewhat similar in concept to the RPC model: a server creates channels and registers them with the network channel API. A client does a lookup for channels on a server. At this point both sides have a shared channel over which they can communicate. Note that communication is one-way: if you want to send information both ways, open two channels one for each direction. \n"},"networkchannels/channel_server.html":{"url":"networkchannels/channel_server.html","title":"Channel server","body":"Channel server\nIn order to make a channel visible to clients, you need to export it. This is done by creating an exporter using NewExporter with no parameters. The server then calls ListenAndServe to listen and handle responses. This takes two parameters, the first being the underlying transport mechanism such as &quot;tcp&quot; and the second being the network listening address (usually just a port number.\nFor each channel, the server creates a normal local channel and then calls Export to bind this to the network channel. At the time of export, the direction of communication must be specified. Clients search for channels by name, which is a string. This is specified to the exporter.\nThe server then uses the local channels in the normal way, reading or writing on them. We illustrate with an &quot;echo&quot; server which reads lines and sends them back. It needs two channels for this. The channel that the client writes to we name &quot;echo-out&quot;. On the server side this is a read channel. Similarly, the channel that the client reads from we call &quot;echo-in&quot;, which is a write channel to the server.\nThe server program is\n/* EchoServer\n */\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;old/netchan&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    // exporter, err := netchan.NewExporter(&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;:2345&quot;)\n    exporter := netchan.NewExporter()\n    err := exporter.ListenAndServe(&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;:2345&quot;)\n    checkError(err)\n\n    echoIn := make(chan string)\n    echoOut := make(chan string)\n    exporter.Export(&quot;echo-in&quot;, echoIn, netchan.Send)\n    exporter.Export(&quot;echo-out&quot;, echoOut, netchan.Recv)\n    for {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Getting from echoOut&quot;)\n        s, ok := &lt;-echoOut\n        if !ok {\n            fmt.Printf(&quot;Read from channel failed&quot;)\n            os.Exit(1)\n        }\n        fmt.Println(&quot;received&quot;, s)\n\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Sending back to echoIn&quot;)\n        echoIn &lt;- s\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Sent to echoIn&quot;)\n    }\n\n}\n\nfunc checkError(err error) {\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(&quot;Fatal error &quot;, err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\n\nNote: at the time of writing, the server will sometimes fail with an error message &quot;netchan export: error encoding client response&quot;.

Web sockets allow a full duplex connection to be established to allow this. Go has nearly complete support for them.\nWarning\nThe Web Sockets package is not currently in the main Go 1.x tree and is not included in the current distributions. To use it, you need to install it by \ngo get golang.org/x/net/websocket\nIntroduction\n(Note: The websockets model changed in release r61 of Go 1.0. This describes the current package.)\nThe standard model of interaction between a web user agent such as a browser and a web server such as Apache is that the user agent makes HTTP requests and the server makes a single reply to each one. In the case of a browser, the request is made by clicking on a link, entering a URL into the address bar, clicking on the forward or back buttons, etc. The response is treated as a new page and is loaded into a browser window.\nThis traditional model has many drawbacks. The first is that each request opens and closes a new TCP connection. HTTP 1.1 solved this by allowing persistent connections, so that a connection could be held open for a short period to allow for multiple requests (e.g. for images) to be made on the same server.\nWhile HTTP 1.1 persistent connections alleviate the problem of slow loading of a page with many graphics, it does not improve the interaction model. Even with forms, the model is still that of submitting the form and displaying the response as a new page. JavaScript helps in allowing error checking to be performed on form data before submission, but does not change the model.\nAJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) made a significant advance to the user interaction model. This allows a browser to make a request and just use the response to update the display in place using the HTML Document Object Model (DOM). But again the interaction model is the same. AJAX just affects how the browser manages the returned pages. There is no explicit extra support in Go for AJAX, as none is needed: the HTTP server just sees an ordinary HTTP POST request with possibly some XML or JSON data, and this can be dealt with using techniques already discussed.\nAll of these are still browser to server communication. What is missing is server initiated communications to the browser. This can be filled by Web sockets: the browser (or any user agent) keeps open a long-lived TCP connection to a Web sockets server. The TCP connection allows either side to send arbitrary packets, so any application protocol can be used on a web socket.\nHow a websocket is started is by the user agent sending a special HTTP request that says &quot;switch to web sockets&quot;. The TCP connection underlying the HTTP request is kept open, but both user agent and server switch to using the web sockets protocol instead of getting an HTTP response and closing the socket.\nNote that it is still the browser or user agent that initiates the Web socket connection. The browser does not run a TCP server of its own. While the specification is complex, the protocol is designed to be fairly easy to use. The client opens an HTTP connection and then replaces the HTTP protocol with its own WS protocol, re-using the same TCP connection.\n"},"websockets/web_socket_server.html":{"url":"websockets/web_socket_server.html","title":"Web socket server","body":"Web socket server\n A web socket server starts off by being an HTTP server, accepting TCP conections and handling the HTTP requests on the TCP connection. When a request comes in that switches that connection to a being a web socket connection, the protocol handler is changed from an HTTP handler to a WebSocket handler. So it is only that TCP connection that gets its role changed: the server continues to be an HTTP server for other requests, while the TCP socket underlying that one connection is used as a web socket.\nOne of the simple HTTP servers we discussed in Chapter 8: HTTP, registered varous handlers such as a file handler or a function handler. To handle web socket requests we simply register a different type of handler - a web socket handler. Which handler the server uses is based on the URL pattern. For example, a file handler might be registered for &quot;/&quot;, a function handler for &quot;/cgi-bin/...&quot; and a web sockets handler for &quot;/ws&quot;.\nAn HTTP server that is only expecting to be used for web sockets might run by\nfunc main() {\n    http.Handle(&quot;/&quot;, websocket.Handler(WSHandler))\n    err := http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:12345&quot;, nil)\n    checkError(err)\n}\n\nA more complex server might handle both HTTP and web socket requests simply by adding in more handlers. \n"},"websockets/the_message_object.html":{"url":"websockets/the_message_object.html","title":"The Message object","body":"The Message object\nHTTP is a stream protocol. Web sockets are frame-based. You prepare a block of data (of any size) and send it as a set of frames. Frames can contain either strings in UTF-8 encoding or a sequence of bytes.\nThe simplest way of using web sockets is just to prepare a block of data and ask the Go websocket library to package it as a set of frame data, send them across the wire and receive it as the same block. The websocket package contains a convenience object Message to do just that. The Message object has two methods, Send and Receive which take a websocket as first parameter. The second parameter is either the address of a variable to store data in, or the data to be sent. Code to send string data would look like\nmsgToSend := &quot;Hello&quot;\nerr := websocket.Message.Send(ws, msgToSend)\n\nvar msgToReceive string\nerr := websocket.Message.Receive(conn, &amp;msgToReceive)\n\nCode to send byte data would look like\ndataToSend := []byte{0, 1, 2}\nerr := websocket.Message.Send(ws, dataToSend)\n\nvar dataToReceive []byte\nerr := websocket.Message.Receive(conn, &amp;dataToReceive)\n\nAn echo server to send and receive string data is given below.
